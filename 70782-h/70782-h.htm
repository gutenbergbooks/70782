<hr class="r15">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Chapter_I">Chapter I.<br>
<br>
IN GENERAL.</h2>

<hr class="r15">

<p>When a state of war was declared to exist on April 6, 1917, the
United States Marine Corps was composed of 462 commissioned
officers, 49 warrant officers, and 13,214 enlisted men on active duty,
a total of 13,725 and, while the corps was expanded to an actual
strength, including reserves, of 75,101 officers and enlisted men, its
high standard was never lowered. When these figures are compared
with the approximate strength of 3,100 at the end of the Civil
War, and of 4,800 at the end of the Spanish War, the growth of the
Marine Corps is illustrated.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that on the outbreak of war, 187 officers and 4,546
enlisted men were on duty beyond the continental limits of the
United States, and 49 officers, and 2,187 enlisted men were serving
on board the cruising vessels of the Navy, only five weeks later, on
June 14, 1917, the Fifth Regiment of Marines, consisting of 70 officers
and 2,689 enlisted men, approximately one-sixth of the enlisted
strength of the Marine Corps, competently organized and ready for
active service, sailed on the <i>Henderson</i>, <i>De Kalb</i>, and <i>Hancock</i> from
the United States, forming one-fifth of the first expedition of American
troops for service in France.</p>

<p>This regiment was soon joined by the Sixth Regiment and the
Sixth Machine Gun Battalion of Marines, and the Fourth Brigade of
Marines was organized, and as one of the two Infantry brigades of the
Second Division of Regulars engaged in actual battle in no less than
eight distinct operations in France, of which four were major operations.</p>

<p>The French Army recognized the splendid work of the Fifth and
Sixth Regiments of Marines by citing them no less than three times
in Army orders for achievements in the Chateau-Thierry sector, in
the Aisne-Marne (Soissons) offensive, and in the Meuse-Argonne
(Champagne). The Sixth Machine Gun Battalion was similarly
cited for its work in the Chateau-Thierry sector and Aisne-Marne
(Soissons) offensive. The Fourth Brigade received a similar citation
for its work in the Chateau-Thierry sector. Since two French
Army citations are sufficient to make an organization eligible for the
award of the French fourragère, the high standard of the Marine units
is evident. Information was received in January, 1920, that the War
Department had accepted the award of the French fourragère in the
colors of the ribbon of the <span lang="fr">Croix de Guerre</span> for several Army organizations
and the three units of the Fourth Brigade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>Within one year after the outbreak of war the Marine Corps
placed about as many enlisted men in France as there were in the
Marine Corps when war was declared.</p>

<p>During the month of June, 1918, when the battle deaths around
Hill 142, Bouresches, Belleau Wood, and Vaux, of Americans attached
to the Second Division amounted to 1,811 (of which at least 1,062 were
Marines) and the nonfatal casualties to 7,252 more (of which 3,615 were
Marines), the legislative strength of the Marine Corps was but 1,323
officers and 30,000 enlisted men; the actual strength on June 30, 1918,
including reserves, was 1,424 officers and 57,298 enlisted men, and
of this total about 300 officers and 14,000 enlisted men were in France.
These latter figures include those Marines who suffered casualties in
the battles of June, 1918.</p>

<p>Approximately 30,000 Marines were sent overseas to join the American
Expeditionary Forces, and 1,600 for naval duty ashore.</p>

<p>During the war a great many additional Marine detachments were
detailed to guard the radio stations, naval magazines, ammunition
depots, warehouses, cable stations and for other naval activities,
and the detachments already established were largely augmented.
No call was made for additional Marines for naval purposes that was
not fully met, and this is of especial interest as the Marine Corps is
essentially a part of the Naval Establishment, and its first duty is to
fill all naval needs and requirements. It was believed to be essential
that the Marine Corps should do its full part in this war, and for that
reason it was absolutely necessary that the Marines should join the
Army on the western front, taking care, however, that this should
not at any time interfere in the slightest degree with the filling
of all naval requirements.</p>

<p>The Marine Corps, while maintaining the Fourth Brigade of
Marines, a total of 258 officers and 8,211 enlisted men, that fought
in eight battle operations suffering approximately 12,000 casualties,
placed and maintained the Fifth Brigade of Marines of the same
strength in France; supplied the commanding general of the Second
Division, and many officers on his staff; furnished a considerable
number of officers to command Army units of the Second and other
divisions, and for staff and detached duty throughout the American
Expeditionary Forces; participated in the naval aviation activities
in France and in the Azores; and during the period of the war succeeded
in performing in a highly satisfactory manner the naval
duties required of it, including the maintenance of two brigades of
prewar strength standing by to protect the Mexican oil fields, and
as an advanced base force in Philadelphia; one in Cuba; one in Santo
Domingo, and one in Haiti; administered and officered the Haitian
Gendarmerie and Guardia Nacional Dominicana; as well as providing
efficient Marine detachments for numerous naval vessels, and
maintaining garrisons at the numerous navy yards and naval stations
in the United States; and in the Virgin Islands; Guantanamo
Bay, Cuba; Pearl Harbor, Hawaiian Islands; Guam; Cavite and
Olongapo, P. I.; Managua, Nicaragua; Peking, China; San Juan, P. R.;
London, England; Cardiff, Wales; Paris, France; and the Azores;
and supplied many officers and enlisted men for special and detached
duty at home and abroad.</p>

STATUTORY AND ACTUAL STRENGTH OF THE MARINE CORPS
ON VARIOUS DATES.</h2>

<hr class="r15">

<h3>STATUTORY STRENGTH.</h3>

<p>The act of Congress of August 29, 1916, increased the authorized
strength of the Marine Corps from 344 officers and 9,921 enlisted
men to 597 officers and 14,981 enlisted men, and the President was
authorized in an emergency to further increase the corps to 693 officers
and 17,400 enlisted men, which he did by Executive order on
March 26, 1917.</p>

<p>On April 6, 1917, Congress declared “that a state of war exists
between the United States and the Imperial German Government”
and one and one-half months later, on May 22, 1917, temporarily
increased the authorized strength to 1,197 commissioned officers, 126
warrant officers, and 30,000 enlisted men. Finally, the act of July
1, 1918, temporarily increased the Marine Corps to 3,017 commissioned
officers, 324 warrant officers, and 75,500 enlisted men, which
is the maximum strength ever authorized for the Marine Corps. Of
this number 17,400 were permanent and 57,650 temporary. In addition
to the above, the act of August 29, 1916, which established the
Marine Corps Reserve, permits the enrollment of reserves without
limit as to number, and on April 6, 1917, there were enrolled, subject
to call to active duty, three Reserve commissioned officers, 24 National
Naval Volunteer officers, 36 Reserve enlisted men, and 928 enlisted
National Naval Volunteers. There were also available for recall to
active duty 65 regular retired commissioned officers, one regular
retired warrant officer, and 210 regular retired enlisted men.</p>

RECRUITING—APPLICANTS, REJECTIONS, ENLISTMENTS—ENLISTMENTS
BY STATES.</h2>

<hr class="r15">

<p>The recruiting service of the corps was enlarged greatly during
the war and it was so well organized and its method of procedure
was so efficient that it was able to stand the enormous increase of
the corps. The real test of any organization comes when a very
great increase is suddenly made and the recruiting service of the
Marine Corps passed that test in a commendable manner.</p>

<p>On August 8, 1918, by Executive order, volunteer enlistments
in the Marine Corps and enrollments in the reserve were stopped,
and from that time until October 1, 1918, no men were enlisted in
the corps with the exception of those whose cases were pending when
the Executive order above mentioned was issued and some whose
enlistments expired and were reenlisted. On September 16, 1918,
the Secretary of War approved the terms of a tentative plan proposed
in an informal conference by representatives of the Navy
Department, the Marine Corps, the General Staff, and the Provost
Marshal General’s Office.</p>

<p>This plan in part provided that the Marine Corps was accorded the
privilege of individual inductions to the amount of 5,000 men, for
the months of October, November, and December, 1918, and January,
1919, and 1,500 thereafter.</p>

<p>As the plan above mentioned operated the men were supplied from
the selective draft, but the choice was given the Marine Corps of
accepting or rejecting men according to the way they measured up
to the Marine Corps standards. The inductees also had a choice
in the matter, so they were really “voluntary inductees.” This plan
was very favorable and permitted the Marine Corps to maintain its
high standard of enlisted personnel.</p>

<p>Owing to the cessation of hostilities there were but few inductions
and none of the inductees ever reached France prior to the armistice
becoming effective. Regular voluntary inductions into the Marine
Corps (through Provost Marshal General) commenced October 1,
1918, and the last man was voluntarily inducted on December 13,
1918. Inductions occurred as follows:</p>

</tr>
</table>

<p>Owing to the signing of the armistice, no more requests were
made to the Provost Marshal General for the induction of men after
November 18, 1918.</p>

<p>On December 2, 1918, the President, by proclamation, directed that
voluntary enlistments of registrants into the Navy and Marine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
Corps would be permitted without notice to local boards, and the
provisions of the selective service law became inoperative so far as
the Marine Corps was concerned.</p>

<p>On December 4, 1918, recruiting on a very limited scale was
resumed by order of the Secretary of the Navy. On that date also,
enrollments in the Marine Corps Reserve were stopped.</p>

HOW OFFICERS WERE OBTAINED AND TRAINED.</h2>

<hr class="r15">

<h3>HOW OFFICERS WERE OBTAINED.</h3>

<p>The outbreak of war made it essential that the corps should be
filled as far as practicable with officers who had had prior military
experience and training, and immediate steps were taken to arrange
for the designation and examination of Marine Corps warrant officers,
noncommissioned officers, graduates of military colleges, and other
civilians with military experience and training.</p>

<p>The appointment of officers subsequent to the declaration of war
up to October, 1917, both for the permanent service and for the
temporary increase authorized for the duration of the war, were drawn
from the following sources:</p>

<p class="p1">In order to expedite the training of the new officers, advantage
was taken of the law providing for a Marine Corps Reserve, and successful
candidates were immediately enrolled as second lieutenants in the
reserve and ordered to Marine Corps posts for instruction pending the
issuance of their commissions in the regular service. Candidates
designated for the examination held July 10, 1917, were authorized
upon designation to enroll as privates in the Marine Corps Reserve,
with the understanding that upon the completion of their examination
they would be ordered to the Recruit Depot at Parris Island, S. C.,
for training pending the receipt of the report of the examining board.
This policy was carried out, and the successful candidates were commissioned
second lieutenants in the Marine Corps, while the unsuccessful
candidates were given the option of continuing in the service as
enlisted men or of being discharged therefrom.</p>

<p>Owing to the unusually large number of young men of excellent
education and fine attainments who had enlisted in the Marine Corps
after the outbreak of war, it was decided that no further appointments
of civilians to the rank of second lieutenant would be made during
the continuance of the war, and that all <ins class="corr" id="tn-21" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'vacancies occuring'">
vacancies occurring</ins> in that
grade, not required for graduates of the Naval Academy, would be
filled by the promotion of meritorious noncommissioned officers.
This decision was promulgated to the service in Marine Corps Orders
No. 25 (Series 1917).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>


<h3>HOW OFFICERS WERE TRAINED.</h3>

<p>The officers appointed from civil life, as soon as enrolled, were
ordered to the Marine barracks, Mare Island, Calif.; San Diego,
Calif.; Parris Island, S. C.; and the Marine Corps rifle range, Winthrop,
Md., for instruction, pending the completion of the buildings
for their use at the Marine barracks, Quantico, Va. Early in July,
1917, the buildings being in readiness, the newly appointed officers,
about 345 in number, were assembled at Quantico, where an officers’
camp of instruction was held, and the course completed in October,
1917.</p>

<p>In carrying out the policy of obtaining officers from the ranks,
orders were issued to commanding officers of every post and station
of the Marine Corps, both at home and abroad, as well as those on
board ship, to the effect that all commissioned officers would be
taken from the ranks, and that the number of men to be designated
from each post to attend the training camp would be a certain percentage
of the number of men stationed at such post or station.
Each commanding officer was ordered to convene a board of three
officers to examine into the qualifications of the men at his post,
and to report in the order of merit the names of the men considered
qualified for entry to the officers’ training camp at Quantico, Va.
These reports were all forwarded to headquarters, where a board
was convened to examine them and to select, in accordance with their
standing as reported by the various boards, the number of men who
it had been decided could be quartered and properly instructed at
Quantico. It was found that about 600 was the limit that could be
accommodated, and approximately this number was selected for the
first camp, which was established at Quantico, Va., in April, 1918.</p>

<p>The officers’ training camp was commanded by an officer of adequate
rank. The students were divided into companies with a
major in command as chief instructor and captains and lieutenants
to assist him. The candidates were given a very rigid course of
instruction and intensive training. Some of the studies pursued
were: Infantry drill regulations, manual of interior guard duty,
bayonet training, bombing, minor tactics, military engineering,
military topography, administration, military law, lectures on gas
and on sea duty, and a practical course on the rifle range.</p>

<p>The training at these camps was most intensive and thoroughly
competitive, so that a man’s position depended entirely upon himself.
The material to draw from was so excellent that comparatively
few of those who entered the camps failed to receive commissions
and many of the young men so commissioned who were assigned to
duty abroad demonstrated that their selection was fully justified.</p>

<p>Many officers also received special training in the schools of the
Overseas Depot at Quantico, Va.</p>

<p>The majority of the members of the first officers’ training camp
were graduated in July, 1918. Three hundred of this camp were commissioned
on July 15, 1918, and 91 on August 15, 1918.</p>

<p>The same proportionate allowance that was made in the United
States was also designated for the Marines serving in France, and
similar means were instituted there to carry out the policy of selection
of men for the training camp. As a result of the camp established<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
over there, 164 second lieutenants were appointed from the
Fourth Brigade in France.</p>

<p>The second officers’ training camp was opened at Quantico, Va.,
on August 20, 1918, the enlisted men forming its personnel having
been selected in exactly the same manner as those attending the first
camp and this procedure was also followed with regard to the Marines
of the American Expeditionary Forces in France. Of the 570
men enrolled 432 were graduated from the second officers’ training
camp, December 16, 1918, and 172 from the Army candidate school
in France, who, immediately upon graduating, were enrolled as
second lieutenants (provisional) in class 4, Marine Corps Reserve,
and subsequently appointed temporary second lieutenants in the
Marine Corps. An extension of three weeks to this course in America
was necessitated by the epidemic of influenza.</p>

<p>There were 235 graduated in July, 1919, from the third officers’
training camp who were enrolled as second lieutenants (provisional)
in class 4, Marine Corps Reserve, and immediately assigned to inactive
duty.</p>

<p>There were also 48 graduates of the Army candidate school in
France, who were enrolled as second lieutenants (provisional) in
class 4, Marine Corps Reserve, and who were discharged or placed on
inactive duty upon their return to the United States, with the exception
of four who were transferred to the temporary service.</p>

<p>Sixty-nine officers were graduated from the Marine Corps school
of machine gun instruction at Utica N. Y.</p>

duties will be found in <a href="#Chapter_XXI">Chapter XXI</a>.</p>


<h3>MARINE SECTIONS, STUDENT ARMY TRAINING CORPS.</h3>

<p>In the act approved August 31, 1918, provision was made for a
Student Army Training Corps, and under date of September 12,
1918, the Secretary of War directed the Provost Marshal General to
allot 1,500 of the registrants authorized for induction into the Student
Army Training Corps to the Marine sections under that organization.
On September 23, 1918, with the approval of the Navy Department,
Marine Corps headquarters designated the following institutions for
the organization of Marine sections of the Student Army Training
Corps and allotted quotas to each ranging from 100 to 190:</p>

<p>It was intended to transfer, from time to time, well-qualified students

Training Corps to aviation duty, or to one of the two recruit camps,
and in both cases men thus recommended, who proved themselves
qualified to become officers, would be ultimately commissioned in
either the Marine Corps Reserve Flying Corps or for general service
in the Marine Corps. In either case after finishing their course in the
Student Army Training Corps they would have been sent to a recruit
camp for the regular course of training, because this would make it
possible to imbue them with the necessary <span lang="fr">esprit de corps</span> and indoctrinate
them with the Marine Corps methods of procedure and training,
both essential to the making of a Marine officer of the highest
type. Owing to the ending of active hostilities there were no graduates
from the Marine sections of the Student Army Training Corps
at the different universities and colleges as they were ordered abandoned
shortly after the armistice became operative.</p>

TRAINING OF ENLISTED MEN IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE.</h2>

<hr class="r15">

<h3>IN UNITED STATES.</h3>

<p>The Marine Corps system of training for the enlisted personnel
during the war was thorough and excellent in every respect, and resulted
in the turning out of men who proved themselves well fitted
for the arduous duties of Marines.</p>

<p>For a short time after the outbreak of the war temporary recruit
depots were opened at the navy yards at Philadelphia, Pa., and Norfolk,
Va., with a capacity of 2,500 at the former and 500 at the latter.
These were used until the regular recruit depots at Parris Island,
S. C., and Mare Island, Calif., could accommodate the recruits.
These two recruit depots were greatly enlarged both in size and scope,
to take care of the temporary increase in strength authorized for the
war, and were soon able to meet all demands made upon them.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the war the course of recruit instruction at the
recruit depot, Parris Island, was of 8 weeks duration, and with but
very few exceptions every recruit passing through this depot received
8 weeks instruction. At the Mare Island recruit depot, the recruits
received 12 weeks training from April 6 to 28, 1917, 9 weeks from
April 29, 1917, to June 21, 1918, and 8 weeks from June 22 to November
11, 1918.</p>

<p>The following table gives a list of the special schools at the Parris
Island recruit depot and the number of graduates from each during
the period between the outbreak of war and the date the armistice
became operative:</p>

<p class="p1">After leaving the recruit depots at Parris Island and Mare Island,
advanced training was given the men at Quantico, Va. This training
was most intensive and as a result all the organizations which were
trained there attained a high state of efficiency. It was made to
approximate as nearly as practicable the real service which the men
would have in the American Expeditionary Forces in France. Officers
who were engaged in this training showed great ingenuity and
efficiency in their attempts to make the training approach as nearly
as possible what the men would be subjected to in actual service.
That they succeeded was shown by the work done by the Marines in
France and other places.</p>

<p>The first troops arrived at the Marine barracks, Quantico, Va., on
May 18, 1917. The maximum enlisted strength was 9,849 on September
12, 1918. The maximum number of officers present at one
time was 484, on August 16, 1918. The strength on November
11, 1918, was 329 officers and 8,798 enlisted men. From May, 1917,
to November 11, 1918, approximately 1,000 officers and 40,000
enlisted men passed through Quantico, Va.</p>

<p>In addition to giving the enlisted men general training at Quantico
in preparation for overseas and other duty, the Overseas Depot was
established on May 19, 1918, for the double purpose of organizing
and training units of the Marine Corps for service with the American
Expeditionary Forces.</p>

<p>Prior to the organization of this depot the Fifth and Sixth Regiments,
the Sixth Machine Gun Battalion, the Base Battalion of the
Fifth Regiment, and two replacement battalions had left the United
States and had become part of the American Expeditionary Force.</p>

<p>The Overseas Depot consisted of an administrative staff and the
various sections as follows: (<em>a</em>) The specialists’ schools for the
technical training of the infantry and machine gun, and the coordination
of these specialists’ arms; (<em>b</em>) the tactical department for the
instruction and training of overseas units in new tactical principles;
(<em>c</em>) the enlisted staff school for the training of first sergeants, mess
sergeants, cooks, company clerks, armorers, etc. Two French and
four Canadian officers, who had abundant experience in the fighting
in Europe, were assigned as advisors of the commanding officer.</p>

<p>The basic independent unit of organization was the platoon, and
the platoon therefore became the principal training unit. In the
organization of this unit the scheme followed was to assure to each
a certain nucleus of enlisted instructors trained in the various
specialties, in addition to the platoon commanders, who were qualified
to carry on the instruction along approved lines within the unit.
This nucleus was taken from the graduates of the specialists’ schools of
the depot. When four such platoons had been formed they were assembled
into a company. The company headquarters, trained in the
enlisted staff school, was added to the four platoons and the company
organization was turned over to the company commander
complete in all details. Battalions were likewise formed by the
consolidation of companies. In every instance the platoon, company,
and the battalion, carried out a regular schedule of drills and
instructions under the supervision of the depot, but all administrative
details were left in the hands of the company and the battalion
commanders. These training schedules were made up in the tactical
department, approved by the commanding officer, and were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
based on the most approved methods in effect at the time. In the cases
of the formation of regimental organizations, of which there were two
formed during the existence of the Overseas Depot, the battalions
upon being formed were turned over to the regimental commander,
and in this case direct supervision by the depot ceased, but all
facilities on hand, such as material, officers acting in an advisory
capacity, training areas, etc., directly attached to the depot, were
placed at the disposal of the regimental commanders who were at
all times in active liaison with the depot.</p>

<p>About 85 per cent of the troops forming the detachments arriving at
the Overseas Depot for service in France had undergone not less than 8
nor more than 12 weeks’ training at the regular recruit depots of the
Marine Corps. The preliminary training received at these recruit
depots was such as to fit the men for general service throughout the
Marine Corps, and resulted in the men being well disciplined, considering
the short time they had been in the service. This facilitated the
more advanced and specialized training they were to receive at the
Overseas Depot. These detachments were composed entirely of
qualified riflemen, having undergone during the recruit period a most
thorough and comprehensive course in the use of the rifle. Upon the
arrival of these detachments they were organized as outlined above,
and the commissioned personnel was assigned to the units from the
officers’ school. The schedule and drills and instructions were provided
them and were carried out under the supervision of specially
selected officers of the tactical department of the Overseas Depot,
including the foreign officers. This training continued until the
units departed for France. Training in open warfare was given
precedence over that of trench warfare from the very beginning in
the proportion of about four to one.</p>

<p>The following units were organized by the Overseas Depot: Third,
Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh Separate Battalions;
Second and Third Machine Gun Battalions; Fifth Brigade Machine
Gun Battalion; Second and Third Separate Machine Gun Battalions;
Eleventh and Thirteenth Regiments; total, approximately,
16,000 officers and enlisted men. The Seventh and Eighth Separate
Battalions were organized and sent to France from Marine
Barracks, Parris Island, S. C.</p>

Depot and the number of graduates:</p>

<p class="p1">In addition to the training described above, 69 officers and 2,084
enlisted men, a total of 2,153, graduated from the Marine Corps
school of machine gun instruction at Utica, N. Y.</p>

<p>Never before in the history of the corps have better drilled and
trained or more generally efficient men been turned out, ready for
duty, upon completion of their training, and to this factor is largely
due the splendid record made by the Marines during the war.</p>

<p>The work of the officers training the Marines was not spectacular,
and they wear no war chevrons, nor decorations for bravery, perhaps,
but they were, nevertheless, a vital factor in whatever success
the Marine Corps met with in the great struggle.</p>

<h3>TRAINING IN FRANCE.</h3>

<p>On June 27, 1917, the First Battalion of the Fifth Regiment actually
landed in France and on July 3, 1917, the entire Fifth Regiment
was under canvas on French soil. From that date every effort was
made to train the men and officers. Elements of the Fifth Regiment
trained as a part of the First Division of Regulars from July 15, 1917,
to September, 1917, in the Gondrecourt training area. From September,
1917, on, the training of the available units of the Fourth
Brigade as a unit of the Second Division of Regulars was conducted
in the Bourmont training area.</p>

<p>Until February, 1918, the training of the Marines in France was
handicapped by the fact that units of the Brigade were engaged in
duties along the Line of Communications (Services of Supply), one
company and a battalion commander being absent in England until
March, 1918. It was not until the middle of February, 1918, that
the Fourth Brigade of Marines (less the company in England) was
conducting its training as a brigade with any degree of satisfaction.
Owing to the well-trained condition of the individual Marine this
condition did not vitally affect his professional ability as was so
distinctly shown by his later accomplishments.</p>

<p>The Fourth Brigade continued its training in the Bourmont training
area until the middle of March, 1918, when it entered the front
line trenches in the Verdun sector.</p>

<p>The Marine replacements received little or no training in a training
area in France as most of them were hurried into the fighting
immediately upon arrival overseas.</p>

<p>To summarize, the average Marine who arrived in France received
at least six weeks’ training in the United States in a recruit depot
and a very short period at Quantico. This is a contrast to the six
months’ training received by the average enlisted man of the Army.
After arrival in France the Marines, except those of the original
Fourth Brigade, received practically no training in a training area
since they joined the brigade almost immediately. The Marines
comprising the Fifth Brigade of Marines received no training in a
regular training area in France.</p>

<p class="p1">From June 27, 1917, to the middle of September, 1917, the Fifth
Regiment was a unit of the First Division of Regulars. Although
the Fifth Regiment was the only organization of Marines in France
at the time, the Fourth Brigade of Marines was formed on October 23,
1917, when Col. Charles A. Doyen cabled acceptance of his appointment
as Brigadier General. From October 26, 1917, to August 8,
1919, the Fourth Brigade was a part of the Second Division of Regulars,
except from October 20-23, 1918, when the Brigade was provisionally
at the disposal of the Ninth French Army Corps, in the
vicinity of Leffincourt. On August 8, 1919, the brigade was transferred
back to the naval service.</p>

<p>On May 29, 1917, in accordance with directions issued by the
President, the Secretary of the Navy directed the Major General<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
Commandant “to organize a force of Marines to be known as the
Fifth Regiment of Marines for service with the Army as a part of
the first expedition to proceed to France in the near future.” The
Fifth Regiment was accordingly organized at the navy yard, Philadelphia,
Pa., on June 7, 1917, with Col. Charles A. Doyen in command,
and Maj. Harry R. Lay, as adjutant.</p>

<p>Gen. Pershing and his staff, accompanied by two Marine officers,
preceded the first expedition to France, sailing late in May, 1917,
from the United States.</p>

<p>The final report of the American commander in chief includes the
following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The offer by the Navy Department of one regiment of Marines to be reorganized
as Infantry was accepted by the Secretary of War, and it became temporarily a part
of the First Division.</p>
</div>

<p>On June 14, 1917, the first expedition of American troops left the
United States for France and the Fifth Regiment of Marines embarked
on the naval transports <i>Henderson</i> and <i>Hancock</i>, and the
auxiliary cruiser <i>De Kalb</i> (former <i><ins class="corr" id="tn-30" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'Printz Eitel'">
Prinz Eitel</ins> Friedrich</i>), formed
approximately one-fifth of it. The fourth group, including the
<i>Hancock</i>, did not sail until June 17, 1917.</p>

<p>The orders received by the convoy commander on the day prior
to sailing read in part: “A military expedition is to be embarked
on the above-named transports, augmented by a regiment of Marines
embarked in naval vessels, for transportation to a destination
already communicated.”</p>

<p>The <i>De Kalb</i> was in group 1, the <i>Henderson</i> in group 2, and the
<i>Hancock</i> in group 4; all were part of the escort and not the convoy.</p>

<p>Rear Admiral Albert Gleaves, the convoy commander, flying his
flag on the <i>Seattle</i>, personally commanded the first group, while
Maj. Gen. W. L. Sibert in the <i>Tenedores</i>, was the senior Army officer
embarked.</p>

<p>The passage of the four groups across the Atlantic was successfully
accomplished without a single disaster, or the loss of a life due to
enemy causes.</p>

<p>At 10.15 p. m., June 22, 1917, the first group, including the <i>De Kalb</i>,
was attacked by enemy submarines. The wake of a submarine was
sighted crossing 50 yards ahead of the <i>Seattle’s</i> bow from starboard to
port. A few seconds later the <i>De Kalb</i> and <i>Havana</i> sighted torpedoes
and opened fire. Two torpedoes passed close to the Havana, and one
passed ahead and one astern of the <i>De Kalb</i>. The second group
encountered two submarines, the first at 11.50 a. m., June 26, 1918,
about 100 miles off the French coast and the second two hours later.</p>

<p>The <i>De Kalb</i> arrived at St. Nazaire, France, on June 26, 1917, the
<i>Henderson</i> on June 27, 1917, and the <i>Hancock</i> on July 2, 1917. On
June 27, 1917, the commanding officer of the Fifth Regiment reported
to the commanding general, First Division, American Expeditionary
Forces, and from that date the Fifth Regiment was considered as being
detached for service with the Army by direction of the President.</p>

<p>Five hundred negro stevedores had been brought from the United
States by the Army to discharge ships, but they were found inadequate
for the large number of ships concerned. The Marines
relieved the situation somewhat by turning to and discharging their
own vessels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>On June 27, 1917, the First Battalion, less the Fifteenth Company
which joined the battalion the following day, disembarked from the
<i>De Kalb</i> and occupied quarters ashore. On this date Lieut. Col.
Logan Feland joined the Fifth Regiment. On June 28, 1917, the
Second and Third Battalions went ashore from the <i>Henderson</i> for a
practice march, and the following day the First Battalion erected
tents for the regiment on a camp site a short distance outside of
St. Nazaire. By 8 p. m., July 3, 1917, the entire Fifth Regiment
was ashore under canvas.</p>

<p>On July 15, 1917, the Fifth Regiment, less the Third Battalion,
which remained behind to perform guard duty, and other detached
units and officers, proceeded to the Gondrecourt training area, and
was stationed in Menaucourt and Naix.</p>

<p>On August 1, 1917, Gen. Pershing inspected the battalions at the
two towns where they were billetted.</p>

<p>On August 15, 1917, the First Division, including the Fifth Regiment
of Marines, was reviewed by its commanding general on a
plateau 12 miles distant from the training area.</p>

<p>On August 19, 1917, Gen. Pershing and Gen. Petain, commander in chief
of all the French forces, inspected the Marines, as a unit of the
First Division. Gen. Petain congratulated the colonel of the regiment
on the splendid appearance of its officers and men, as well as the
cleanliness of the towns.</p>

<p>Every opportunity was taken advantage of to perfect the regiment
for combat duty, but this work was handicapped by the fact that
many units of the regiment were scattered along the Line of Communications
performing duty of a necessary but of a nontraining
nature. One company and one battalion commander left the regiment
on September 22, 1917, for duty in England, and did not rejoin
the regiment until March 11, 1918. Many other officers and men
were placed on detached duty.</p>

<p>On September 24, 25, 1917, that part of the Fifth Regiment available
for training arrived in the Bourmont training area and was
stationed at Damblain and Breuvannes.</p>

<p>The following letter dated November 10, 1917, addressed by Gen.
Pershing to the Major General Commandant is both complimentary
and explanatory as to why the Marines were used along the Line of
Communications:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Your Marines having been under my command for nearly six months, I feel that I
can give you a discriminating report as to their excellent standing with their brothers
of the Army and their general good conduct. I take this opportunity, also, of giving
you the reasons for distributing them along our Line of Communications which, besides
being a compliment to their high state of discipline and excellent soldierly appearance,
was the natural thing to do as the Marine Regiment was an additional one in
the Division and not provided for in the way of transportation and fighting equipment
in case the Division should be pushed to the front. When, therefore, service of
the rear troops and military and provost guards were needed at our base ports and
in Paris it was the Marine Regiment that had to be scattered, in an endeavor to
keep the rest of the organized division intact.</p>

<p>I have been obliged to detach a number of your officers as assistant provost marshals
in France and in England, all of which I take it you will agree with me was highly
complimentary to both officers and men, and was so intended. I can assure you that as
soon as our service of the rear troops arrive, including a large number of officers and
men for the specific duties now being performed by your men, the Marines will be
brought back once more under your brigade commander and assigned to the duties
which they so much desire in the Second Regular Division under General Bundy.</p>

<p>It is a great pleasure to report on your fine representatives here in France.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>Col. Charles A. Doyen was in command of the Fifth Regiment
from the date of its organization on June 7, 1917, to October 29,
1917; and Lieut. Col. Hiram I. Bearss from October 30, 1917, to
December 31, 1917. Col. Wendell C. Neville having <ins class="corr" id="tn-32" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'arrived on on board'">
arrived on board</ins> the <i>De Kalb</i> at St. Nazaire, France, on December 28, 1917,
reported to the Fourth Brigade for duty on January 1, 1918, and
on that date assumed command of the Fifth Regiment, continuing
in command until July, 1918.</p>

<p>The Sixth Machine Gun Battalion of Marines was organized at the
Marine barracks, Quantico, Va., by order of the Major General
Commandant on August 17, 1917. The battalion was designated
the First Machine Gun Battalion, but on January 20, 1918, after
arrival in France, was renamed the Sixth Machine Gun Battalion.
On December 14, 1917, the battalion sailed from New York on the
<i>De Kalb</i>, arriving at St. Nazaire, France, December 28, 1917. On
January 3, 1918, the battalion arrived at Damblain in the Bourmont
training area and began training with headquarters at Germainvilliers.</p>

<p>Maj. Edward B. Cole was in command of the Sixth Machine Gun
Battalion of Marines from the date of its organization until June 10,
1918, when he received a mortal wound.</p>

<p>On August 4, 1917, in accordance with directions issued by the
President, the Secretary of the Navy directed the Major General
Commandant “to organize a force of Marines, to be known as the
Sixth Regiment of Marines, for service with the Army in France,”
and the regiment was organized as directed.</p>

<p>On September 23, 1917, the First Battalion of the Sixth Regiment
sailed on the <i>Henderson</i> from New York and landed at St. Nazaire,
France, on October 5, 1917. On October 17, 1917, the Seventy-third
Machine Gun Company, Headquarters, and Supply Companies,
and Col. Albertus W. Catlin, commanding officer of the Sixth Regiment,
with his Staff, sailed from Philadelphia, Pa., on the <i>De Kalb</i>,
and from New York on October 18, 1917, arriving at St. Nazaire,
France, on November 1, 1917. On October 31 1917, the Third
Battalion of the Sixth Regiment sailed from New York on board
the <i>Von Steuben</i> and anchored at Brest, France, on November 12,
1917. On January 24, 1918, the Second Battalion of the Sixth
Regiment sailed on the <i>Henderson</i> from New York and arrived at
St. Nazaire, France, February 6, 1918, and with the arrival of this
last battalion, the entire Sixth Regiment of Marines was in France.</p>

<p>On October 23, 1917, the Fourth Brigade of Marines was organized,
with Brig. Gen. Charles A. Doyen in command. Brig. Gen. Doyen
continued in command until May 7, 1918, when he published in
General Orders No. 5, that he had relinquished command. Maj.
Harry R. Lay was the first brigade adjutant, and performed the
duties of that office from October 24, 1917, to August 9, 1918, except
during the period February 7 to May 9, 1918, when Maj. Holland M.
Smith was brigade adjutant.</p>

<p>On October 26, 1917, Brig. Gen. Charles A. Doyen, United States
Marine Corps, assumed command of the Second Division as its first
commanding general, and announced his staff in General Orders No. 1,
with station at Bourmont, Haute-Marne, serving as such until relieved
by Maj. Gen. Omar Bundy, United States Army, who announced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
that he assumed command in General Orders No. 4, November 8,
1917.</p>

<p>Like the Fifth Regiment, the Sixth Regiment spent several
months performing the necessary but undesired duties along the
Line of Communications. On January 12, 1918, Col. Albertus W.
Catlin established headquarters for the Sixth Regiment at Blevaincourt
in the Bourmont training area. The Third Battalion arrived
in this area on January 12, 1918, the headquarters units the same
date, the First Battalion during January, 1918, and the Second Battalion
on February 10, 1918.</p>

<p>Therefore, on February 10, 1918, the Fourth Brigade of Marines
was in the Bourmont training area intact, with the exception of
one company on duty in England, training industriously as an
infantry brigade of the Second Division. While the brigade had been
organized on October 23, 1917, and had actually functioned as a
brigade with elements of all three of its units present from January
12, 1918, it was not until February 10, 1918, that the Brigade
organization was perfected.</p>


<h3>FIFTH BRIGADE OF MARINES.</h3>

<p>On September 5, 1918, the Major General Commandant directed
the post commander, Marine barracks, Quantico, Va., to organize
brigade headquarters of the Fifth Brigade, United States Marine
Corps.</p>

<p>This brigade was accordingly organized and was composed of the
Eleventh and Thirteenth Regiments and the Fifth Brigade Machine
Gun Battalion. The companies of the Fifth Brigade were designated
by letters and not by numbers.</p>

<p>Brig. Gen. Eli K. Cole was designated as the brigade commander
and on September 15, 1918, he and the Brigade Staff sailed from
Hoboken, N. J., on board the <i>Von Steuben</i>, arriving at Brest, France,
on September 24, 1918.</p>

<p>The Thirteenth Regiment left the Overseas Depot at Quantico, Va.,
on Friday, September 13, 1918, and on September 15, 1918, sailed
from Hoboken, N. J., on board the <i>Henderson</i> and <i>Von Steuben</i>,
arriving at Brest, France, on September 25, 1918.</p>

<p>On September 29, 1918, Eleventh Regiment Headquarters and
the First Battalion sailed on the <i>De Kalb</i> from Philadelphia, Pa.,
and arrived at Brest, France, on October 13, 1918. On October 16,
1918, the Second and Third Battalions of the Eleventh Regiment
sailed from Brooklyn, N. Y., on board the <i>Agamemnon</i> and <i>Von
Steuben</i> and arrived at Brest, France on October 25, 1918.</p>

<p>On October 28, 1918, the Fifth Brigade Machine Gun Battalion
sailed from South Brooklyn, N. Y., on board the <i>Henderson</i> and
arrived at Brest, France, on November 9, 1918. With the arrival
of this unit the entire Fifth Brigade was in France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>


<h3>AVIATION UNITS.</h3>

<p>On January 21, 1918, the First Marine Aeronautic Company
arrived at naval base No. 13, Ponta Delgada, Azores.</p>

<p>On July 30, 1918, the First Marine Aviation Force (less Squadron
D) disembarked at Brest, France, and formed the Day Wing of the
Northern Bombing Group. Squadron D joined the Day Wing in
October, 1918.</p>


<h3>MARINE DETACHMENTS FOR NAVAL BASES.</h3>

<p>On January 21, 1918, and on July 20, 1918, detachments for the
naval base No. 13, arrived at Ponta Delgada, Azores.</p>

<p>On September 30, 1918, the detachment for naval base No. 29,
arrived at Cardiff, Wales.</p>

<p>On December 29, 1918, the detachment for the naval forces in
France, staff office, Paris, France, landed at St. Nazaire, France.</p>

OPERATIONS IN GENERAL.</h2>

<hr class="r15">

<p>While the battle operations of the Fourth Brigade as an infantry
brigade of the Second Division of Regulars overshadowed all others
taken part in by Marine Corps personnel, those operations were by no
means the only ones participated in by officers and men of the Marine
Corps.</p>

<p>The commanding general of the Second Division from early in
August, 1918, to the date of demobilization, and several officers on
his staff were Marine officers. Officers of the Marine Corps were at
various times attached to the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Sixth,
Twenty-sixth, Thirty-second, Thirty-fifth, Ninetieth, and Ninety-second
Divisions, and in some cases engaged in operations with them.
Brig. Gen. John A. Lejeune assumed command of the Sixty-fourth
Infantry Brigade of the Thirty-second Division, then in the front
line on the Swiss border in the Suarce sector, on July 5, 1918. He
was in command of this brigade on July 22, 1918, when it was withdrawn
from the above-mentioned sector and continued in command
until July 25, 1918, when he left to command the Fourth Brigade of
Marines. Between July 5, 1918, and July 22, 1918, Brig. Gen. Lejeune,
in addition to the Sixty-fourth Brigade, commanded three
French infantry regiments. Col. Robert H. Dunlap was in command
of the Seventeenth Field Artillery Regiment of the Second Field
Artillery Brigade, Second Division, from October 30, 1918, to February,
1919. Col. Hiram I. Bearss commanded the One hundred and
second Regiment of the Fifty-first Infantry Brigade, Twenty-sixth
Division, in the St. Mihiel offensive. Col. Frederic M. Wise commanded
the Fifty-ninth Regiment of the Eighth Infantry Brigade,
Fourth Division, from September 5, 1918, to January 4, 1919, during
which period he participated in the St. Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne
major operations. From January 1, 1919, to February 9, 1919, Col.
Wise commanded the Eighth Infantry Brigade of the Fourth Division.</p>

<p>A few Marine officers and enlisted men engaged in Army aviation
operations and suffered casualties. About 20 Marine officers were
sent to France as observers and as such participated in operations
with American, French, and British forces. Marine aviation personnel
served in France as the Day Wing of the Northern Bombing
Group of the Navy. Marine flyers served with Squadrons 213 (pursuit
squadron), 217, and 218 (bombing squadrons), Royal Flying
Corps of England; and with pursuit, observation, and bombing squadrons
of the French Flying Corps. Quite a few casualties were suffered
by the Marine aviation personnel.</p>

<p>The First Marine Aeronautic Company, naval base No. 13, Ponta
Delgada, Azores, equipped for water flying only, performed patrol
duty from January, 1918, until November 11, 1918.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>The Marine Aviation Section, naval air station, Miami, Fla., performed
arduous patrol duties in the Florida Straits in connection with
the Navy from July, 1918, until the date the armistice went into effect.</p>

<p>Marine detachments served on board all the American battleships
attached to the British Grand Fleet and also on the American battleships
which based at Castletown Berehaven, Bantry Bay, Ireland.
Marines also served on board many of the cruisers which escorted
the vessels transporting Army troops to Europe. They were also
attached to many other naval vessels such as the <i>Brooklyn</i>, <i>Helena</i>,
and <i>Wilmington</i>, in China and Siberian waters, at one time landing at
Vladivostok in conjunction with other naval forces; on the <i>Galveston</i>
on the Murman Coast; and on the <i>Pittsburgh</i> in South American waters.
Marines were also on the <i>San Diego</i> when that vessel was sunk, and
the <i>Minnesota</i> when that ship was damaged by German mines.
Marines were in intimate contact with the Germans in Guam and
Philadelphia in conjunction with the Navy in the first hours of the
war.</p>

<p>One brigade of Marines was held in readiness in Texas for possible
trouble in Mexico which might endanger the Allies’ oil supply. Another
was scattered throughout the island of Cuba. Large detachments of
Marines were stationed in the Azores and Virgin Islands in the nature
of advanced base forces, while an advanced base force at Philadelphia
was available at all times for naval needs.</p>

<p>Marine forces were also stationed in Guam, Philippine Islands,
Peking, Pearl Harbor, and Nicaragua and they assisted materially,
under the limited conditions, in the war.</p>

<p>Active operations were conducted in Haiti and Santo Domingo
against bandits during the period of the war by Marine forces, the
Haitian Gendarmerie and the Guardia Nacional Dominicana, the two
latter organizations being composed of natives and administered and
officered by the Marine and Navy personnel. Casualties were suffered
by Marines in the operations in Santo Domingo, 4 Marines
being killed, 13 wounded, and 1 officer wounded, between April 6,
1917, and November 11, 1918.</p>

UNITS COMPOSING, AND THE COMMANDING GENERALS OF, THE
SECOND DIVISION—VERDUN OPERATIONS.</h2>

<hr class="r15">

<h3>THE SECOND DIVISION OF REGULARS.</h3>

<p>The first unit which ultimately formed a part of the Second Division
arriving in France was the Fifth Regiment of Marines which landed in
France with the first expedition of American troops in June, 1917.
One Marine lieutenant colonel, who afterwards was the first chief of
staff of the Second Division, and another Marine lieutenant colonel,
who later commanded the Seventeenth Field Artillery of the Second
Division, accompanied Gen. Pershing and his staff when they sailed
from the United States late in May, 1917.</p>

<p>On October 26, 1917, Brig. Gen. Charles A. Doyen, United States
Marine Corps, assumed command of the Second Division as its first
commanding general and announced his staff in General Orders, No.
1, with station at Bourmont, Haute-Marne, France. Lieut. Col.
Logan Feland, United States Marine Corps, was the first chief of
staff. On November 8, 1917, Maj. Gen. Omar Bundy, United States
Army, assumed command, published such fact in General Orders,
No. 4, November 8, 1917, and was in command of it during the
operations in the Verdun and Chateau-Thierry sectors. Maj. Gen.
James G. Harbord, United States Army, commanded the division
in the Aisne-Marne (Soissons) offensive in July, 1918. Maj. Gen.
John A. Lejeune assumed command of the division on July 28, 1918,
and retained command until its demobilization in August, 1919.
Many Marine officers occupied positions of importance and responsibility<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
on the staff of the commanding general, Second Division.
A Marine officer commanded the Seventeenth Field Artillery during
the Meuse-Argonne offensive, and other Marine officers commanded
battalions of the Ninth Infantry and Fifteenth Field Artillery for a
time.</p>

<p>Neither the Marine Brigade nor any other element of the Second
Division was the first American unit to enter the front lines since the
First Division enjoyed that honor in October, 1917, when it entered
the line in the quiet Toul sector.</p>

<p>The Fourth Brigade remained in the Bourmont training area, with
headquarters at Damblain, until March 14, 1918, when it commenced
movement into subsectors of the Verdun front, the first units of the
brigade entering the front line during the night of March 16-17,
1918, with headquarters at Toulon. On April 1, 1918, brigade headquarters
was changed to Moscou. The brigade remained on the
Verdun front until May 14, 1918, when it proceeded to an area around
Vitry-le-François for open warfare training, with headquarters at
Venault-les-Dames. In the meantime, on May 6, 1918, Brig. Gen.
James G. Harbord assumed command of the brigade, relieving
Brig. Gen. Doyen who had been ordered to the United States on
account of his physical condition. Brig. Gen. Doyen relinquished
command of the brigade most unwillingly, and the reasons for his
relief are best set forth in the words of the citation of a Navy distinguished
service medal posthumously awarded to him, reading as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>By reason of his abilities and personal efforts, he brought this brigade to the very
high state of efficiency which enabled it to successfully resist the German army in the
Chateau-Thierry sector and Belleau Woods. The strong efforts on his part for nearly a
year undermined his health and necessitated his being invalided to the United States
before having the opportunity to command the brigade in action, but his work was
shown by the excellent service rendered by the brigade, not only at Belleau Woods,
but during the entire campaign when they fought many battles.</p>
</div>

<p>Gen. Pershing in a letter to Brig. Gen. Doyen stated in part:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Your service has been satisfactory and your command is considered as one of the
best in France. I have nothing but praise for the service which you have rendered
in this command.</p>
</div>

<p>On May 14, 1918, the brigade left the area around Vitry-le-François
as it was unsuitable and proceeded to an area around Gisors-Chaumont-en-Vixen,
with headquarters at Bou-des-Bois. The brigade
was in this area when sudden orders came to move to the Chateau-Thierry
sector.</p>

<p>On May 27, 1918, Brig. Gen. John A. Lejeune and Maj. Earl H.
Ellis sailed from New York on board the <i>Henderson</i> and arrived at
Brest, France, on June 8, 1918.</p>

AISNE DEFENSIVE, HILL 142, BOURESCHES, AND <span lang="fr">BOIS DE LA BRIGADE
DE MARINE</span>, IN THE CHATEAU-THIERRY SECTOR.</h2>

<hr class="r15">

<p>In order to appreciate understandingly the importance of the
early operations participated in by the Marine Brigade as a unit of
the Second Division it is necessary to remember that in 1918, prior
to the middle of July, the offensive was in the hands of the Imperial
German Staff, and that between March 21, 1918, and July 15, 1918,
the Germans directed no less than five major offensives against the
Allied lines in efforts to bring the war to a successful conclusion for
the Central Powers. American troops assisted in breaking up every
one of these drives, but the Second Division, including the Marines,
opposed only one, that in the Chateau-Thierry sector. It should
also be noted that on March 28, 1918, the American commander in
chief placed all of the American forces at the disposal of Marshal
Foch, who had been agreed upon as commander in chief of the
Allied Armies, to be used as he might decide.</p>

<p>The first offensive (Somme) of the Germans was stopped within
a few miles of Amiens, and the second (Lys) overran Armentieres.
In this second German offensive, which lasted from April 9 to 27, 1918,
and which has been designated by the Americans as a major operation,
there were approximately 500 American troops engaged.</p>

<p>Then late in May, 1918, with startling success, which brought a
corresponding depression to the morale of the Allies, the Germans
launched their third offensive, west of Rheims, crossed the Chemin-des-Dames,
captured Soissons, and the last day of May found them
marching in the direction of Paris down the Marne Valley. Again
the American commander in chief placed every available man at
the disposal of Marshal Foch. It was at this critical time, when the
Allies were facing a grave crisis, that the Second Division, including
the Marine Brigade, together with elements of the Third and Twenty-eighth
Divisions, were thrown into the line and, in blocking the German
advance in the Chateau-Thierry sector, rendered great assistance
in stopping the most dangerous of the German drives.</p>

<p>The first report of the American commander in chief states that
“the Third Division, which had just come from its preliminary training
area, was hurried to the Marne. Its motorized machine gun
battalion preceded the other units and successfully held the bridgehead
at the Marne opposite Chateau-Thierry. The Second Division,
in reserve near Montdidier, was sent by motor trucks and other
available transport to check the progress of the enemy toward
Paris.”</p>

<p>The final report of the American commander in chief with reference
to this third German offensive stated in part:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On reaching the Marne that river was used as a defensive flank and the German
advance was directed toward Paris. During the first days of June something akin
to a panic seized the city and it was estimated that 1,000,000 people left during the
spring of 1918. * * *</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>The Second Division, then in reserve northwest of Paris and preparing to relieve
the First Division, was hastily diverted to the vicinity of Meaux on May 31, and,
early on the morning of June 1, was deployed across the Chateau-Thierry-Paris road
near Montreuil-aux-Lions in a gap in the French line, where it stopped the German
advance on Paris.</p>
</div>

<p>Without minimizing in any way the splendid actions of the Twenty-sixth
Division at Seicheprey and Xivray in April 1918, or the brilliant
exploit of the First Division at Cantigny on May 28, 1918, the fact
remains that the Second Division, including the Marine Brigade,
was the first American division to get a chance to play an important
part on the western front, and how well it repelled this dangerous
thrust of the Germans along the Paris-Metz highway is too well
known to be dwelt upon at length in this brief history.</p>

<p>The fighting of the Second Division in the Chateau-Thierry sector
was divided into two parts, one a magnificently stubborn defensive
lasting a week and the other a vicious offensive. The defensive
fighting of the Second Division between May 31 and June 5, 1918,
was part of the major operation called by the Americans the Aisne
defensive. Without discussing at this time the tactical or strategical
significance of the work of the Second Division in the Aisne defensive,
suffice to say that its psychological effect upon the morale of the
Allies was tremendous and has been recognized in practically every
writing worthy of consideration up to the present date.</p>

<p>The close of the Aisne defensive on June 5, 1918, found the line
of the Second Division well established at that point of the Marne
salient nearest Paris, but not including Hill 142, Bois de Belleau,
Bouresches, or Vaux, and the Germans were in possession of Chateau-Thierry
on the right of the Second Division, and continued to hold
that town until about July 17, 1918.</p>

<p>On June 6, 1918, the Second Division snatched the initiative from
the Germans and started an offensive on its front which did not end
until July 1, 1918. The Marine Brigade captured Hill 142 and
Bouresches on June 6, 1918, and in the words of Gen. Pershing,
“sturdily held its ground against the enemy’s best guard divisions,”
and completely cleared Bois de Belleau of the enemy on June 26,
1918, a major of Marines sending in his famous message: “Woods
now U. S. Marine Corps’ entirely.” The American commander in
chief in his first report calls this fighting “the battle of Belleau Wood”
and states, “our men proved their superiority, and gained a strong
tactical position with far greater loss to the enemy than to ourselves.”
In his final report he states: “The enemy having been halted, the
Second Division commenced a series of vigorous attacks on June 4,
which resulted in the capture of Belleau Woods [on June 26] after
very severe fighting. The village of Bouresches was taken soon
after [on June 6] and on July 1 Vaux was captured. In these operations
the Second Division met with most desperate resistance by
Germany’s best troops.” On July 1, 1918, the Third Brigade captured
Vaux. The Artillery, Engineers, and the other elements of
the Second Division assisted materially in these successes, while the
Seventh regiment of the Third Division was in Belleau Wood for a
few days about the middle of June.</p>

<p>During these 31 days of constant fighting, the last 26 of which
has been defined by general headquarters of the American Expeditionary
Forces as a “local engagement,” the Second Division suffered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
1,811 battle deaths (of which approximately 1,062 were Marines)
and suffered additional casualties amounting to 7,252 (of which
approximately 3,615 were Marines). It was that fighting and those
9,063 casualties that first made the name Chateau-Thierry famous.</p>

<p>The achievements of the Fourth Brigade of Marines in the Chateau-Thierry
sector was twice recognized by the French. The first, which
changed the name of the Bois de Belleau, was a beautiful tribute
spontaneously made to the successes and to the losses of the Fourth
Brigade of Marines, and shows the deep effect that the retaking of
Belleau Wood and other near-by positions from the Germans had
on the feelings of the French and the morale of the Allies. Official
maps were immediately modified to conform with the provisions of
the order, the <i lang="fr">plan directeur</i> used in later operations bearing the
name “<span lang="fr">Bois de la Brigade de Marine</span>.” The French also used this
new name in their orders, as illustrated by an ordre général dated
August 9, 1918, signed by the commanding general of the Sixth
French Army, reading in part as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot" lang="fr">

<p>Avant la grande offensive du 18 Juillet, les troupes américaines faisant partie de la
VIe Armée française se sont distinguées en enlevant à l’ennemi le Bois de la Brigade

<p>The second recognition by the French of the Marines’ work in the
Chateau-Thierry sector were citations of the Fourth Brigade, Fifth
and Sixth Regiments, and the Sixth Machine Gun Battalion of
Marines, in French army orders, that of the brigade, the others
being identical, reading as follows:</p>

<p>During the first attack on Belleau Wood on June 6, 1918, Col.
Albertus W. Catlin was severely wounded and was relieved in command
of the Sixth Regiment by Lieut. Col. Harry Lee, who continued
in command until the regiment was demobilized in August,
1919.</p>

<p>When Maj. Edward B. Cole was mortally wounded on June 10,
1918, he was relieved in command of the Sixth Machine Gun Battalion
of Marines by Capt. Harlan E. Major. On June 11, 1918,
Captain Major was relieved by Capt. George H. Osterhout, who retained
command until relieved by Maj. Littleton W. T. Waller, jr., on
June 21, 1918.</p>

<p>During the fighting in the Chateau-Thierry sector the headquarters
of the Fourth Brigade was successively at Montreuil-aux-Lions,
(in an automobile for one-half hour on the way to the front lines),
Issonge farmhouse, and La Loge farmhouse. After being relieved
by elements of the Twenty-sixth Division during the night of July
5-6, 1918, the brigade moved to an area in rear of the lines and occupied
what was known as the Line of Defense or Army Line, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
headquarters at Nanteuil-sur-Marne. The brigade remained there
until July 16, 1918.</p>

<p>During the time the above-described fighting was going on the
Germans were frustrated in their fourth 1918 drive (Noyon-Montdidier
defensive) between June 9 and 15, 1918, and of course being
busy in the vicinity of Bois de Belleau, the Marines had no opportunity
of engaging in it.</p>

<p>Having been blocked in the Marne salient, the Germans attacked
for the fifth time in 1918 on July 15, and as events turned out it
was the last, for from the time of its failure they were on the defensive.
The Allied troops including many Americans held this attack,
called by the Americans the Champagne-Marne defensive, which
was on a large scale, and the grand initiative passed from the Germans
to the Allies on July 18, 1918, when Marshal Foch launched
his initial major offensive, termed by the Americans the Aisne-Marne.
In this magnificent and gigantic operation the Marine
Brigade and other elements of the Second Division played leading
parts in the vicinity of Soissons.</p>

<p>General headquarters, American Expeditionary Forces, on May
28, 1919, credited the Second Division units with participation in
the major operation of Champagne-Marne defensive, but on June 2,
1919, rescinded this credit.</p>

<br>
THE AISNE-MARNE OFFENSIVE (SOISSONS).</h2>

<hr class="r15">

<p>On July 11, 1918, Brig. Gen. James G. Harbord, commanding
general of the Marine Brigade, received notification of his appointment
as a major general, and two days later left on a five days’
leave of absence. As Col. Neville had been evacuated to a base
hospital after leaving the Chateau-Thierry sector, Lieut. Col. Harry
Lee assumed temporary command of the brigade. Maj. Gen.
Harbord and Col. Neville both returned in time to enter the Aisne-Marne
offensive, the former in command of the Second Division
and the latter in command of the Fourth Brigade.</p>

<p>Of the six Allied offensives taking place in 1918 on the Western
Front, designated by the Americans as major operations, the Fourth
Brigade of Marines, with the other units of the Second Division,
participated in three, the first being the vast offensive known as the
Aisne-Marne, in which the Marine Brigade entered the line near
Soissons.</p>

<p>On July 17, 1918, the First Moroccan Division and the First and
Second Divisions of American Regulars were hurriedly and secretly
concentrated, by terribly fatiguing, forced night marches over
roads jammed with troops, artillery, and tanks, through rain and
mud, in the Bois de Retz, near Soissons. Headquarters of the
Fourth Brigade was established at Vivieres.</p>

<p>The getting to the “jump-off” on time for this operation will
always share in Marine Corps history with the glorious victory that
followed.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of July 18, 1918, Marshal Foch threw these
three picked divisions at the unsuspecting Germans with overwhelming
success, and again on the following day. The American
commander in chief in his first report stated:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The place of honor in the thrust toward Soissons on July 18 was given to our
First and Second Divisions, in company with chosen French divisions. Without
the usual brief warning of a preliminary bombardment, the massed French and American
artillery, firing by the map, laid down its rolling barrage at dawn while the
Infantry began its charge. The tactical handling of our troops under these trying
conditions was excellent throughout the action. * * * The Second Division
took Beaurepaire Farm and Vierzy in a very rapid advance, and reached a position in
front of Tigny at the end of its second day.</p>
</div>

<p>In his final report he stated:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Gen. Petain’s initial plan for the counterattack involved the entire western face
of the Marne salient. The First and Second American Divisions, with the First
French Moroccan Division between them, were employed as the spearhead of the
main attack, driving directly eastward, through the most sensitive portion of the
German lines to the heights south of Soissons. The advance began on July 18, without
the usual brief warning of a preliminary bombardment, and these three divisions at
a single bound broke through the enemy’s infantry defenses and overran his artillery,
cutting or interrupting the German communications leading into the salient. A
general withdrawal from the Marne was immediately begun by the enemy, who still
fought stubbornly to prevent disaster. * * *</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>The Second Division advanced 8 kilometers in the first 26 hours, and by the end of
the second day was facing Tigny, having captured 3,000 prisoners and 66 field guns.
It was relieved the night of the 19th by a French division. The result of this counter-offensive
was of decisive importance. Due to the magnificent dash and power displayed
on the field of Soissons by our First and Second Divisions the tide of war was
definitely turned in favor of the Allies.</p>
</div>

<p>Maj. Gen. James G. Harbord, commanding the Second Division
in this operation, describes the two days’ fighting of his division in
these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is with keen pride that the division commander transmits to the command the
congratulations and affectionate personal greetings of Gen. Pershing who visited the
division headquarters last night. His praise of the gallant work of the division on
the 18th and 19th is echoed by the French high command, the Third Corps commander,
American Expeditionary Forces, and in a telegram from the former division
commander. In spite of two sleepless nights, long marches through rain and mud,
and the discomforts of hunger and thirst, the division attacked side by side with the
gallant First Moroccan Division and maintained itself with credit. You advanced
over 6 miles, captured over 3,000 prisoners, 11 batteries of artillery, over 100 machine
guns, minnenwerfers, and supplies. The Second Division has sustained the best
traditions of the Regular Army and the Marine Corps. The story of your achievements
will be told in millions of homes in all Allied lands to-night.</p>
</div>

<p>This was one of the greatest strategical successes of Marshal Foch,
and that the part played by the Marines was appreciated by the
French is illustrated by the Fifth and Sixth Regiments and the
Sixth Machine Gun Battalion being cited in French Army orders.
The citations of the Sixth Regiment (that of the Fifth Regiment
being similar) and that of the Sixth Machine Gun Battalion are
quoted below:</p>

<p>Following the advance of the first day, brigade headquarters was
moved forward to a cave in Vierzy.</p>

<p>Col. Logan Feland was in command of the Fifth Regiment during
the Aisne-Marne offensive, near Soissons, and continued in command
of it with the exception of two days in July, 1918 (when Brig. Gen.
Lejeune commanded the Fourth Brigade and Col. Neville the Fifth
Regiment), until March 21, 1919, when he was relieved by Col. Harold
C. Snyder, who retained command until the date of demobilization.</p>

<p>The Fourth Brigade was relieved about midnight July 19, 1918, and
after remaining in a reserve position until July 22, 1918, marched to an
area farther in the rear, but still in a reserve position, brigade headquarters
being established at Taillefontaine. Alter final relief from this
active sector the brigade was billeted July 24-25, 1918, in an area
around Nanteuil-le-Haudouin, brigade headquarters being established
at Nanteuil. The brigade remained in this area until July 31, 1918.</p>

<p>On July 25, 1918, Brig. Gen. John A. Lejeune arrived, and assumed

MARBACHE SECTOR, NEAR PONT-A-MOUSSON—ST. MIHIEL OFFENSIVE.</h2>

<hr class="r15">

<p>During the last two days of July, 1918, the units of the brigade entrained
for a 24-hour railroad journey which took them to an area
around Nancy, with headquarters at Villers-les-Nancy, where they
remained resting and refitting until August 9, 1918.</p>

<p>On August 7, 1918, information was received of the promotion of
Brig. Gen. Lejeune to the grade of major general, and of Col. Neville
to the grade of brigadier general, both to date from July 1, 1918.</p>

<p>Col. Albertus W. Catlin arrived in the United States on board the
<i>America</i> on August 3, 1918. Col. Catlin, having been wounded on
June 6, 1918, during the first attack on Bois de Belleau, was admitted
to Hospital No. 2, Paris, France, on the next day, was discharged on
July 22, 1918, granted two months’ sick leave, and sailed for New
York from Brest, France, on July 25, 1918.</p>

<p>On August 5, 1918, movement of units of the brigade was started
for the occupation of the Marbache subsector, near Pont-a-Mousson,
on the Moselle River. By August 8, 1918, the movement was completed,
with Headquarters established at Scarponne just across the
Moselle River from Dieulouard. The sector was quiet and occupation
uneventful except for an enemy raid which was successfully
repulsed and prisoners captured.</p>

<p>On August 8, 1918, Lieut. Col. Earl H. Ellis was appointed adjutant
of the Fourth Brigade, relieving Lieut. Col. Harry R. Lay, who had
been detailed as inspector general of the Second Division.</p>

<p>The relief from the Marbache sector was completed on August 18,
1918, and the brigade moved to an area about 20 kilometers southeast
of Toul, headquarters being established at Favieres. Intensive
training for the impending St. Mihiel offensive was indulged in here.</p>

<p>The brigade started to move from this area on the night of September
2, 1918, and after a series of night marches, during which time
headquarters were established at Pont St. Vincent, Velaine-en-Haye,
and Bouvron, the brigade arrived just outside of Manonville, headquarters
being established in Manonville. From September 12 to
16, 1918 the brigade was engaged in the St. Mihiel offensive in the
vicinity of Remenauville, Thiaucourt, Xammes, and Jaulny as a unit
of the Second Division of the First Corps of the First Army. Headquarters
during these operations were successively at 1 kilometer
north of Lironville, Thiaucourt, and finally at Manonville, on September
16, 1918.</p>

<p>On September 20, 1918, the brigade moved to an area south of
Toul, with headquarters at Chaudenay. The brigade remained in
this area until September 25, 1918, when it moved by rail to an area
south of Chalons-sur-Marne, with headquarters at Sarry.</p>

THE CHAMPAGNE—BATTLE OF BLANC MONT RIDGE—CAPTURE
OF ST. ETIENNE—MARCH TO LEFFINCOURT.</h2>

<hr class="r15">

<p>Marshal Foch, having asked for an American division to assist in
breaking through the powerful German defenses in the Champagne,
the Second Division, including the Marine Brigade, was temporarily
placed at the disposal of the Fourth French Army under Gen. Gouraud
from September 27, 1918, to October 10, 1918. At first it was directly
subject to the orders of Marshal Petain, but before the actual fighting
began it was placed directly under the orders of Gen. Gouraud.</p>

<p>On September 28, 1918, the Fourth Brigade moved by bus and
marching to the Souain-Suippes area, with brigade headquarters at
Suippes.</p>

<p>On October 1, 1918, in an order of the Second Division, the commanding
general of the Second Division encouraged his division with
the following words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. The greatest battles in the world’s history are now being fought. The Allies
are attacking successfully on all fronts. The valiant Belgian Army has surprised and
defeated the enemy in Flanders; the English, who have been attacking the enemy
without ceasing since August 8, have advanced beyond the Hindenburg Line, between
Cambria and St. Quentin, capturing thousands of prisoners and hundreds of cannon;
the heroic Allied Army of the Orient has decisively defeated the Bulgars; the British
have captured over 50,000 prisoners in Palestine and have inflicted a mortal blow on
the Turk; and our own First Army and the Fourth French Army have already gained
much success in the preliminary stages of their attack between the Meuse and Suippes
Rivers.</p>

<p>2. Owing to its world-wide reputation for skill and valor, the Second Division was
selected by the commander in chief of the Allied Armies as his special reserve, and has
been held in readiness to strike a swift and powerful blow at the vital point of the
enemy’s line. The hour to move forward has now come, and I am confident that our
division will pierce the enemy’s line, and once more gloriously defeat the Hun.</p>
</div>

<p>The Battle of Blanc Mont Ridge was one of the most powerful
and effective blows struck under the direction of Marshal Foch
against the retreating Germans, and its brilliantly successful conclusion
was due in a great degree to the military genius of Maj. Gen.
John A. Lejeune of the Marines.</p>

<p>On September 27, 1918, Maj. Gen. John A. Lejeune called on
Gen. Gouraud at the headquarters of the Fourth French Army, who
explained the situation at the front to him. Facing a large relief
map of the battlefield, Gen. Gouraud placed his hand on the Blanc
Mont Ridge and said: “General, this position is the key of all the
German defenses of this sector including the whole Rheims Massif.
If this ridge can be taken the Germans will be obliged to retreat
along the whole front 30 kilometers to the river Aisne. Do you
think your division could effect its capture?” Maj. Gen. Lejeune
responded that he felt certain the Second Division could take the
stronghold pointed out, whereupon he was informed that he would
be ordered to make the attack within a few days and was directed
to prepare a plan for the assault.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>At this time the Second Division was directly subject to the
orders of Marshal Petain, but later in the day Gen. Gouraud informed
Maj. Gen. Lejeune that after an explanation of the circumstances
Marshal Petain had assigned the division to the Fourth French
Army.</p>

<p>The general plan provided for an attack by the whole Fourth
French Army between the Argonne and the Suippes River.</p>

<p>On October 1, 1918, the brigade with the rest of the Second Division
marched to the front line near Somme-Py on the night of October
1-2, 1918, and relieved elements of a French division. The brigade
headquarters was located in the trenches about 2½ kilometers south
of Somme-Py. The relief was effected before daylight without
incident.</p>

<p>The Battle of Blanc Mont Ridge was fought and won by the
Second Division, as a unit of the Fourth French Army, between
October 3 and 9, 1918, over the desolated white chalky ground of
the Champagne, which was scarred and shell pocked by years of
artillery fire, marked with huge mine craters, gridironed with an
intricate maze of deep trenches and concrete fortifications, and covered
with tangled masses of wire.</p>

<p>The overwhelming success and the far-reaching effect of the
Second Division’s part in these operations, the cleaning up of the
Essen Hook, the capture of Blanc Mont Ridge, and the capture of
St. Etienne, are well described in general terms in the following excerpts
from official publications.</p>

<p>That the plan was as brilliantly executed as it was daringly conceived
is shown by this extract from an order of the Second Division,
dated November 11, 1918, reading in part as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the Champagne district, October 2 to 10, it fought beside the Fourth French
Army. On October 3 it seized Blanc Mont Ridge, the keystone of the arch of the
main German position, advanced beyond the ridge and, although both flanks were
unsupported, it held all its gains with the utmost tenacity, inflicting tremendous
losses on the enemy. This victory freed Rheims and forced the entire German Army
between that city and the Argonne Forest to retreat to the Aisne, a distance of 30
kilometers.</p>
</div>

<p>The amazing success of the attack and the vital effect of the
capture of Blanc Mont Ridge and St. Etienne is described in the
words of Gen. Gouraud himself in a letter to Marshal Foch, reading
in part as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Because of the brilliant part played by this “Grand Unit” in the offensive of the
Fourth Army during the autumn of 1918, I propose the Second American Division
for a citation in “The Order of the Army” upon the following specific grounds:</p>

<p>The Second Infantry Division, United States, brilliantly commanded by
Gen. Lejeune * * * played a glorious part in the operations of the Fourth Army
in the Champagne in October, 1918. On the 3d of October this division drove forward
and seized in a single assault the strongly entrenched German positions between
Blanc Mont and Medeah Ferme, and again pressing forward to the outskirts of Saint-Etienne
à Arnes it made in the course of the day an advance of about 6 kilometers.</p>

<p>It captured several thousand prisoners, many cannon and machine guns, and a
large quantity of other military matériel. This attack, combined with that of the
French divisions on its left and right, resulted in the evacuation by the enemy of
his positions on both sides of the river Suippe and his withdrawal from the Massif
de Notre-Dame-des-Champs.</p>
</div>

<p>The further opinion of the French as to the results and effect of
the Second Division’s operations in Champagne is set forth in the
following-quoted extract from Information Bulletin No. 12 of the
Fourth French Army dated October 7, 1918:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Up to October 4, at which date the present bulletin is written, the Fourth Army
has pushed its advance up to objectives of the very highest importance. A splendid
American division, full of dash and ardor, the Second Division, United States, placed
at the disposition of the Twenty-first Corps on October 3, made itself master of Massif
du Blanc Mont, which dominates the valley of the Arnes and gives us excellent outlook
on the valley of the Suippe in rear of the region of Monts. This conquest rapidly
brought about the downfall of Notre-Dame-des-Champs and the Grand Bois de Saint
Souplet.</p>
</div>

<p>The American commander in chief in his first report describes
the Battle of Blanc Mont in the following words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Second Division conquered the complicated defense works on their front
against a persistent defense worthy of the grimmest period of trench warfare and
attacked the strongly held wooded hill of Blanc Mont, which they captured in a
second assault, sweeping over it with consummate dash and skill. This division
then repulsed strong counterattacks before the village and cemetery of St. Etienne
and took the town, forcing the Germans to fall back from before Rheims and yield
positions they had held since September, 1914.</p>
</div>

<p>In his final report the American commander in chief remarked as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Second Division completed its advance on this front by the assault of the
wooded heights of Mont Blanc, the key point of the German position, which was
captured with consummate dash and skill. The division here repulsed violent
counterattacks and then carried our lines into the village of St. Etienne, thus forcing
the Germans to fall back before Rheims and yield positions which they had held
since September, 1914.</p>

Sixth Regiment being identical) reads as follows:</p>

</div>

<p>On October 10, 1918, having been relieved from the line in the
Blanc Mont sector, the brigade took station in the Suippes-Somme
Suippes-Nantivet area and the adjacent camps with headquarters at
Suippes, being assigned as Fourth French Army reserve. The
brigade remained in this area resting and refitting until October 14,
1918, when, in accordance with orders, it marched to the Vadenay-Bouy-la-Veuve-Dampierre
area, north of Chalons-sur-Marne, with
headquarters at Bouy. While here orders were received placing the
Fourth Brigade provisionally at the disposal of the Ninth French
Army Corps to hold a sector in the region Attigny-Voncq-Aisne
River.</p>

<p>Accordingly on October 20, 1918, the brigade was temporarily
detached from the Second Division and marched to the area Suippes-Nantivet-Somme-Suippes,
with headquarters at Suippes. On October
21, 1918, in obedience to orders, the Marines hiked to the vicinity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
of Leffincourt, where brigade headquarters was established. While
about to take over the assigned sector the Fourth Brigade received
orders to rejoin the Second Division, which was preparing to enter the
Meuse-Argonne offensive. After a hard march these orders were
obeyed and brigade headquarters established at Mont Pelier on
October 23, 1918.</p>

<p>On October 24, 1918, Maj. Matthew W. Kingman relieved Maj.
Littleton W. T. Waller, jr., in command of the Sixth Machine Gun Battalion
of Marines, Maj. Waller joining the Second Division staff as

THE MEUSE-ARGONNE OFFENSIVE—CROSSING THE MEUSE RIVER.</h2>

<hr class="r15">

<p>On October 25, 1918, the brigade moved to the Les Islettes area
with brigade headquarters at Camp Cabaud. On the evening of
October 26, 1918, it arrived in the area south of Exermont and
bivouacked in the woods there that night with brigade headquarters
at Exermont. The brigade remained in bivouac in this area until
the night of October 30-31, 1918, when it moved forward into line
to participate in the immense Meuse-Argonne offensive which had
started on September 26, 1918, the Second Division being assigned
as a unit of the Fifth Corps.</p>

<p>Relieving elements of the Forty-Second Division, just south of
Landres-et-St. Georges, the Marine Brigade early on the morning of
November 1, 1918, jumped-off, following a terrific barrage, for its
final operation of the war, the conclusion of which at 11 o’clock on
the morning of November 11, 1918, found the Marines firmly established
on the heights of the far bank of the Meuse River, after an
advance of 30 kilometers.</p>

<p>The splendid work of the Second Division, including the Marines,
is described in official reports, and excerpts from some are given
below.</p>

<p>In recommending that the Second Division be cited in General
Headquarters Orders for its excellent work in the attack of November
1-11, 1918, the commanding general, First Army, wrote on January
16, 1919, in part, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>4. In the First Army attack of November 1, 1918, the Second Division was selected
and so placed in the battle line that its known ability might be used to overcome the
critical part of the enemy’s defense. The salient feature of the plan of attack was
to drive a wedge through Landres-et-St. Georges to the vicinity of Fosse. It was
realized that if the foregoing could be accomplished the backbone of the hostile
resistance west of the Meuse would be broken and the enemy would have to retreat to
the east of the Meuse. Success in this plan would immediately loosen the flanks
of the First Army. The Second Division was selected to carry out this main blow.</p>

<p>5. The Second Division accomplished the results desired in every particular on
the first day of the attack, not only clearing the hostile defenses of Landres-et-St.
Georges and the Bois de Hazios but continuing its advance to the vicinity of Fosse,
i. e., about 9 kilometers. This decisive blow broke the enemy’s defense and opened
the way for the rapid advance of the Army.</p>
</div>

<p>With reference to the first day’s attack, the commanding general,
Fifth Army Corps, wrote officially on November 2, 1918, in part as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The division’s brilliant advance of more than 9 kilometers, destroying the last
stronghold on the Hindenburg Line, capturing the Freya Stellung, and going more than
9 kilometers against not only the permanent but the relieving forces in their front,
may justly be regarded as one of the most remarkable achievements made by any troops
in this war. For the first time, perhaps, in our experience the losses inflicted by your
division upon the enemy in the offensive greatly exceeded the casualties of the division.
The reports indicate moreover that in a single day the division has captured
more artillery and machine guns than usually falls to the lot of a command during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
several days of hard fighting. These results must be attributed to the great dash and
speed of the troops, and to the irresistible force with which they struck and overcame
the enemy.</p>
</div>

<p>The following citation in Fifth Army Corps General Orders No. 26,
dated November 20, 1918, gives a further description of these operations:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Second Division, in line at the launching of the attack, broke through the
strong enemy resistance, and, leading the advance, drove forward in a fast and determined
pursuit of the enemy, who, despite new divisions hastily thrown in, was driven
back everywhere on its front. This division drove the enemy across the Meuse, and
under heavy fire and against stubborn resistance, built bridges and established itself
on the heights. The cessation of hostilities found this division holding strong positions
across the Meuse and ready for a continuation of the advance.</p>
</div>

<p>An order of the Second Division, dated November 5, 1918, reading
in part as follows, tells what occurred subsequent to the first day’s
attack:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>During the night of November 2-3 the Second Division moved forward overcoming
the resistance of the enemy’s advanced elements, and at 6 a. m., it attacked and seized
the enemy’s line of defense on the ridge southeast of Vaux-en-Dieulet.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, the enemy, having reorganized his line on the border of Belval
Forest, was again attacked and defeated. After nightfall and in a heavy rain, the
advanced elements of the division pressed forward through the forest, and occupied
a position on the heights south of Beaumont, 8 kilometers in advance of the divisions
on our right and left.</p>

<p>During the night of November 4-5, the division again pressed forward, occupied
Beaumont and Letanne and threw the enemy on its front across the Meuse.</p>
</div>

<p>An order of the Second Division, dated November 12, 1918, describing
the historic crossing of the Meuse River on the night before
the armistice became operative, reads as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. On the night of November 10, heroic deeds were done by heroic men. In the
face of a heavy artillery and withering machine gun fire, the Second Engineers threw
two foot bridges across the Meuse and the first and second battalions of the Fifth
Marines crossed resolutely and unflinchingly to the east bank and carried out their
mission.</p>

<p>2. In the last battle of the war, as in all others in which this division has participated,
it enforced its will on the enemy.</p>
</div>

<p>The commanding general of the Fifth Army Corps has this to say
about the crossing of the Meuse by the Marines, who were assisted by
the Artillery, Engineers, and other troops of the Second Division:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Especially I desire to commend the division for the crowning feat of its advance in
crossing the Meuse River in face of heavy concentrated enemy machine gun fire, and
in driving the enemy’s troops before it, and in firmly establishing itself upon the
heights covering the desired bridgehead. This feat will stand among the most memorable
of the campaign.</p>
</div>

<p>With reference to the crossing of the Meuse River the American
commander in chief reported as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the night of November 10, the Fifth Corps forced a crossing of the Meuse against
heavy enemy resistance between Mouzon and Pouilly, and advanced to the Inor-Mouzon
road with two battalions holding the high ground northwest of Inor.</p>
</div>

<p>The general success achieved by the Second Division in the Argonne-Meuse
offensive is well described by the words of the order citing
Maj. Gen. John A. Lejeune, of the Marines, for an Army distinguished
service medal, reading in part as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the Meuse-Argonne offensive his division was directed with such sound military
judgment and ability that it broke and held, by the vigor and rapidity of execution
of its attack, enemy lines which had hitherto been considered impregnable.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p>During this fighting the headquarters of the Fourth Brigade was
successively established at Exermont, one-half kilometer north of

<p>On “the eleventh hour, the eleventh day of the eleventh month,
of the year 1918,” Brig. Gen. Wendell C. Neville, commanding
general of the Fourth Brigade of Marines, published the following
tribute to the officers and men of the Fourth Brigade:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Upon this, the most momentous hour in the history of the World War, the undersigned
wishes to express to his command his sincere appreciation of their unfailing
devotion to duty and their heroic and courageous action during the recent operations.</p>

<p>The time, when the results of our efforts during the past year are shown, is here.
The hour has arrived when the convulsion which has shaken the foundations of the
civilized world has ceased. The enemy is defeated and the principles of freedom
and democracy have triumphed over barbarism and autocracy. We may all feel
justly proud of the extent of our participation which has forced the enemy to a cessation
of hostilities. It is fitting, at this time, to think of those of our comrades who have
fallen on the field of honor and rejoice in the fact that they did not give their lives in
vain.</p>

<p>Your display of fortitude, determination, courage, and your ability to fight has
upon more than one occasion been a determining factor in making history, and your
work has had a direct bearing upon the remarkable chain of events which have this
day culminated in such a satisfactory manner. Along the fronts of Verdun, the Marne,
the Aisne, Lorraine, Champagne, and the Argonne, the units of the Fourth Brigade
Marines have fought valiantly, bravely, and decisively. They have nobly sustained
the sacred traditions and have added glorious pages to the already illustrious history
of the United States Marine Corps. It is a record of which you may all be proud.</p>

MARCH TO THE RHINE—ARMY OF OCCUPATION—SUMMARY OF
OPERATIONS OF THE FOURTH BRIGADE.</h2>

<hr class="r15">

<h3>MARCH TO THE RHINE.</h3>

<p>On November 17, 1918, the Second Division commenced its march
to the Rhine, passing through Belgium and Luxembourg. The
German frontier was reached November 25, 1918, crossed on December
1, 1918, the Rhine reached December 10, 1918, and crossed on
December 13, 1918. During this march and up to the time the Fourth
Brigade settled down to its occupation duty in Germany, brigade
headquarters were successively established at Margut, Bellefontaine,
Arlon, Usseldange, Berg, Eppeldorf, Neuerburgh, Waxweiler, Prum,
Budesheim, Wiesbaum, Antweiler, Neuenahr, Burgbrohl, Rheinbrohl,
and Hönningen.</p>


<h3>WITH THE ARMY OF OCCUPATION.</h3>

<p>The duties of the Fourth Brigade with the Army of Occupation
in Germany were uneventful, the outstanding features being the
establishment of a Rhine River patrol, manned and commanded by
Marines; an extended visit, inspection, and review by the Secretary
of the Navy; and the operation of the Second Division, including
the Marines, made about the middle of June, 1919, in which an
advanced position was taken as a part of the concentration of the
Third Army immediately preceding the signing of the treaty of peace
by the Germans.</p>

<p>Headquarters of the Fourth Brigade during the greater part of
the occupation of Germany was at Nieder Bieber, while during the
last operation when the advanced position was taken, just prior to
Germany signing the peace treaty, it was at Herschbach. On the
date the treaty was signed the Fifth Regiment, with headquarters
at Hatenfels, occupied the most advanced position ever occupied
by Marines in Germany.</p>

<p>Just before departing from Germany headquarters was at Nieder
Bieber, and with the exception of Brest, France, this was the last
headquarters the brigade had in Europe.</p>

<p>Maj. Charles D. Barrett relieved Lieut. Col. Earl H. Ellis as brigade
adjutant in April, 1919, and held that position until the brigade was
demobilized. Lieut. Col. Ellis was assigned to duty as second in
command of the Fifth Regiment. On March 12, 1919, Col. Logan
Feland was temporarily appointed brigadier general to rank from
March 9, 1919, and accepted appointment and executed oath on
March 17, 1919. On March 21, 1919, Col. Harold C. Snyder assumed
command of the Fifth Regiment, relieving Brig. Gen. Logan Feland,
who, after acting as aide for the Secretary of the Navy, arrived in the
United States on the <i>Von Steuben</i> on May 13, 1919.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p>Just before the Second Division left Germany the commanding
general of the Army of Occupation expressed his appreciation of the
services of that division in a letter dated July 2, 1919, which is
published in General Orders, Second Division, No. 68, July 5, 1919:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As your magnificent division is about to leave his command, it is with a sense of
gratitude for its splendid achievments while in the American Expeditionary Forces
that the army commander expresses to you, and to your gallant officers and men his
appreciation of your services.</p>

<p>After occupying a defensive sector between Verdun and St. Mihiel, you were placed
in the line of battle and met, with stubborn resistance, the onslaughts of the enemy’s
hordes near Chateau-Thierry. Your action at Belleau Woods and your attack upon
and capture of Vaux must ever remain brilliant exploits in our military history.</p>

<p>At Soissons, side by side with a veteran French division, you proved to our Allies
the fighting value of the Army of the United States, and at St. Mihiel, in the first
great American offensive, your prowess in attack was irresistible.</p>

<p>When in October, 1918, the Allied High Command desired to reinforce the French
Army by American troops of great offensive worth, by real “shock troops,” you were
loaned to Gen. Gouraud’s Fourth French Army and delivered your famous assault on
Blanc Mont Ridge, releasing from German menace the historic city of Rheims.</p>

<p>In the closing phase of the Meuse-Argonne operations, certainly no troops contributed
more to the enemy’s destruction than your division. After taking Landres-et-St.
Georges, <ins class="corr" id="tn-57" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'Bayonnville-et-Chennery'">
Bayonville-et-Chennery</ins>, and the Bois-de-la-Folie, you pierced the
Bois-de-Belval, and by skillful night fighting and marching you cleared the enemy
from the left bank of the Meuse and forced a crossing of the river.</p>

<p>Your brilliant exploits in battle are paralleled by the splendid example of soldierly
bearing and discipline set by your officers and men while a part of the Army of Occupation.
That spirit and dash which carried your men through the enemy’s defenses
still predominated when the Army was recently concentrated, preparatory to a further
advance into unoccupied Germany.</p>

<p>Officers and soldiers of the Second Division, your achievments and sacrifices have
earned for you and for your fallen comrades the praise and gratitude of our Nation.</p>
</div>


<h3>SUMMARY OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE FOURTH BRIGADE.</h3>

<p>A summary of the operations of the Fourth Brigade of Marines is
set forth below:</p>

<p>The Fourth Brigade of Marines as a unit of the Second Division
participated in actual battle in France in the following sectors between
the inclusive dates set down (as published in General Orders No.
37, Second Division, April 25, 1919):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Toulon sector, Verdun: From March 15 to May 13, 1918.</p>

<p>Aisne defensive, in the Chateau-Thierry sector: From May 31 to June 5, 1918.</p>

<p>Chateau-Thierry sector (capture of Hill 142, Bouresches, Belleau Wood): From
June 6 to July 9, 1918.</p>

<p>Aisne-Marne (Soissons) offensive: From July 18 to July 19, 1918.</p>

<p>Marbache sector, near Pont-a-Mousson on the Moselle River: From August 9 to
August 16, 1918.</p>

<p>St. Mihiel offensive, in the vicinity of Thiaucourt, Xammes, and Jaulny: From
September 12 to September 16, 1918.</p>

<p>Meuse-Argonne (Champagne) including the capture of Blanc Mont Ridge and St.
Etienne: From October 1 to October 10, 1918.</p>

<p>Meuse-Argonne (including crossing of the Meuse River): From November 1 to
November 11, 1918.</p>
</div>


<h3>SILVER BANDS FOR COLORS.</h3>

<p>Under the rulings of General Headquarters, American Expeditionary
Forces, the Marine Corps units serving with the Second Division
are entitled to silver bands on the staffs of their colors for battle
participation in the above-mentioned engagements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>


<h3>MAJOR OPERATIONS.</h3>

<p>General Headquarters, American Expeditionary Forces, ruled that
the Second Division, including the Fourth Brigade of Marines, participated
in only four major operations, the Aisne defensive (May
31 to June 5, 1918); the Aisne-Marne offensive (July 18 and 19,
1918); the St. Mihiel offensive (Sept. 12 to 16, 1918); and the
Meuse-Argonne offensive (Oct. 1 to 10; 1918, and Nov. 1 to 10, 1918).
The operations which resulted in the capture of Blanc Mont and
St. Etienne were construed to be included in the Meuse-Argonne
offensive despite the fact that the operations were a part of
the operations of the Fourth French Army, far to the west of the
western limit of the American Meuse-Argonne sector and further
that the work of the Second Division was continued by another
American division. The operation which resulted in the capture of
Hill 142, Bouresches, <span lang="fr">Bois de la Brigade de Marine</span>, by the Marine
brigade, assisted by Artillery, Engineers, etc., of the Second Division,
and the capture of Vaux by the Third Brigade, Engineers and
Artillery of the Second Division, were held to be local engagements
rather than a major operation. The Second Division suffered about
9,000 casualties in the Chateau-Thierry sector.</p>

<p>In addition to the above major operations, Marine Corps personnel,
other than that of the Fourth Brigade and Second Division, participated
in the Champagne-Marne defensive, the Oise-Aisne offensive,
and the Ypres-Lys offensive.</p>

<br>
WITH THE NAVY ON BOARD THE BATTLESHIPS AND CRUISERS.</h2>

<hr class="r15">

<h3>WITH THE BRITISH GRAND FLEET.</h3>

<p>Division 9 of the Atlantic Fleet, composed of the <i>New York</i>
(flagship), <i>Wyoming</i>, <i>Florida</i>, and <i>Delaware</i>, was detailed for service
with the British Grand Fleet, rendezvoused on November 24, 1917,
in Lynnhaven Roads, Chesapeake Bay, and sailed for its destination
the following day.</p>

<p>The division took the northern passage and was 13 days en route,
4 days of which were spent in holding its own against a 90-mile
gale off the Newfoundland coast. On December 7, 1917, the American
battleships anchored with the British Grand Fleet in Scapa Flow,
Orkney Islands, after a rousing reception, and on December 26 were
designated the Sixth Battle Squadron of the British Grand Fleet.</p>

<p>From the time of its arrival to November 29, 1918, this squadron,
with the addition of the <i>Texas</i> in February, 1918, and the substitution
of the <i>Arkansas</i> for the <i>Delaware</i> in July, 1918, operated with
the British Grand Fleet, basing most of the time in Scapa Flow and
the remainder of the time in the Firth of Forth (Rosyth). The
squadron took its regular turn at convoy duty, patrol duty, target
practice, and fleet exercises with all the other squadrons of the
British Grand Fleet.</p>

<p>The squadron was at sea on an average of from 8 to 10 days each
month and followed the procedure of the Grand Fleet in all respects,
even going so far as to shift to the British method of signaling.</p>

<p>Maj. Nelson P. Vulte was division Marine officer of this division
the entire time it was a unit of the British Grand Fleet.</p>

<p>With reference to the operations of this division the Secretary of
the Navy in his annual report made the following statements:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Assigned one of the two places of honor and importance in the battle line, this
American division did its full share of the Grand Fleet’s work, including patrol
search for the enemy, protection of convoys, mining, and other forces, and, most
important of all, in the repeated attempts to engage the German High Seas Fleet,
for which the ships of the Grand Fleet were kept in the highest state of efficiency
and readiness. Our battleships were attacked six times by submarines. On one
occasion, off the Norwegian coast, four torpedoes were fired at the <i>Florida</i> and two
at the <i>Delaware</i>, and at another time three were fired at the <i>New York</i>. Not one
of our vessels was hit, and the only damage done was to the <i>New York</i>, which while
leading the division into Pentland Firth, was rammed by a submerged submarine.
Two blades of her propeller were broken off, but officers and crew were convinced
that the blows from the propeller sank the U-boat.</p>
</div>


<h3>SURRENDER OF THE GERMAN HIGH SEAS FLEET.</h3>

<p>The American battleships occupied a prominent position in the
north column of the Grand Fleet on the occasion of the surrender
of the German High Seas Fleet, on November 21, 1918, off the mouth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
of the Firth of Forth and assisted in escorting it into that port
where the German vessels were searched and later dispatched under
guard to Scapa Flow, Orkney Islands, for internment.</p>

<p>The American vessels did not accompany the surrendered German
war vessels to Scapa, but were detached from the British Grand
Fleet on December 1, 1918, and sailed from Rosyth for Portland
(Weymouth). The day after the surrender of the German Fleet
the <i>Nevada</i>, which had been serving with Division 6 of the Atlantic
Fleet in Bantry Bay, Ireland, joined Division 9, at Rosyth and
proceeded with it to Portland.</p>


<h3>AT CASTLETOWN BEREHAVEN, BANTRY BAY, IRELAND.</h3>

<p>The Annual Report of the Secretary of the Navy makes the following
remarks concerning Division 6:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Division 6, composed of the <i>Utah</i> (flagship), <i>Nevada</i>, and <i>Oklahoma</i>, was based on
Berehaven, Bantry Bay, Ireland, its principal duty being to protect our convoys
from possible enemy raiders. This division made two trips into the Channel, escorting
convoys when enemy submarines were reported in the vicinity.</p>
</div>

<p>Maj. Leon W. Hoyt was the division Marine officer of this division
during its entire stay in European waters.</p>

<p>The <i>Nevada</i> joined the American battleships of Division 9 the day
after the surrender of the German Fleet off Rosyth, near Edinburgh.</p>


<h3>ESCORTING THE PRESIDENT INTO BREST.</h3>

<p>Division 9 joined Division 6 at Portland Bill and both divisions
left that port in time to assist the <i>Pennsylvania</i> in escorting President
Wilson, on board the <i>George Washington</i>, into the harbor of Brest.</p>


<h3>WELCOMED HOME BY NAVAL REVIEW.</h3>

<p>On December 14, 1918, our battleships sailed from Brest for the
United States, arrived off Ambrose Lightship the afternoon of
Christmas Day, and the next morning steamed into New York
Harbor where they were accorded a great demonstration. The
naval review was followed by a land parade of all the returning
officers, Bluejackets, and Marines.</p>


<h3>THE ATLANTIC FLEET.</h3>

<p>Col. (Brig. Gen.) John T. Myers was the fleet Marine officer of
the Atlantic Fleet from before the outbreak of the war to August
23, 1918, being relieved on that date by Col. Frederic L. Bradman
who continued on that duty until after the armistice.</p>

<p>Col. John F. McGill was force Marine officer of the Battleship
Force and later force Marine officer of Battleship Force Two until
August 14, 1918, when he was relieved by Maj. Harold C. Wirgman,
who continued as such until the force was suspended in September,
1918.</p>

<p>Lieut. Col. James McE. Huey was force Marine officer of Battleship
Force One from September 3, 1917 to December 29, 1917,
when he was relieved by Maj. Edwin N. McClellan who continued<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
as such until March 28, 1918, when the Marines were temporarily
withdrawn from the force.</p>

<p>Maj. Richard H. Tebbs, jr., was force Marine officer of the Cruiser
Force.</p>


<h3>THE PACIFIC FLEET.</h3>

<p>Col. Richard M. Cutts was fleet Marine officer of the Pacific Fleet
from November 1, 1916 to October 14, 1918; and Lieut. Col. Charles
B. Taylor from October 15, 1918 until after the armistice.</p>


<h3>THE ASIATIC FLEET.</h3>

<p>The Marines of the <i>Brooklyn</i>, flagship of the Asiatic Fleet, participated
in the activities around Vladivostok, Siberia, in 1918.</p>

<p>In June, 1918, Vladivostok, and practically all of Siberia, was
under the control of the Bolsheviki. The Bolsheviki, assisted by
German and Austrian prisoners of war, were resisting the advance
of the Czecho-Slovaks, who were trying to reach Vladivostok. In
that city on June 29, 1918, there were approximately 12,000 well-organized
Czecho-Slovaks, only about 2,500 of whom were armed or
equipped. On the foregoing date the Czecho-Slovaks in the city
took it over from the Bolsheviki after a three hour battle near its
center, and on the afternoon of that day Rear Admiral Austin M.
Knight, commander in chief of the Asiatic Fleet, ordered a detachment
of American Marines ashore to guard the American consulate
and to act as part of an Allied force composed of British, Japanese,
Chinese, and Czecho-Slovaks, to patrol the city.</p>

<p>In July, 1918, Marines from the <i>Brooklyn</i> acted as guards over
German and Austrian prisoners of war on Russian Island, about
5 miles from Vladivostok, while Marines from the same vessel constituted
part of an Allied military force of American and British
marines, Japanese and Chinese bluejackets, and Czecho-Slovak
soldiers, which was organized to prevent a threatened strike and
disorder among the workmen in the Russian navy yard at Vladivostok.</p>

<p>The <i>Albany</i> was at Vladivostok from April 2, 1919, until relieved
by the <i>New Orleans</i> on July 25, 1919. Each of these ships, while
they were anchored off Vladivostok, kept a small guard of Marines
at the United States Naval radio station on Russian Island.</p>

<p>Col. Carl Gamborg-Andresen was fleet Marine officer of the Asiatic
Fleet from August 25, 1915 to July 17, 1917; Col. Louis McC. Little
from July 18, 1917 to April 25, 1918; and Col. Eli T. Fryer from that
date until after the armistice.</p>

THE ACTIVITIES OF THE FIFTH BRIGADE.</h2>

<hr class="r15">

<h3>THE FIFTH BRIGADE.</h3>

<p>The units of the Fifth Brigade were never together as a brigade
in France or at any time an element of a division, and for that reason
its commanding general was assigned additional duty in the American
Expeditionary Forces.</p>

<p>Brig. Gen. Eli K. Cole, the first commanding general of the Fifth
Brigade, arrived in France on September 24, 1918, and proceeded
to headquarters, Forty-first Division (First Depot Division), St.
Aignan, France, reporting there October 1 to 4, 1918; on October 6,
1918, he joined the Second Division at Souain, France, as an observer
and remained with the Second Division until October 26, 1918, when
he left to report at St. Aignan. On October 28, 1918, Brig. Gen.
Cole arrived at St. Aignan and assumed command of the Forty-first
Division (First Depot Division). From December 27, 1918, to
January 10, 1919, he commanded the First Replacement Depot.
From January 12 to February 3, 1919, he commanded the American
Embarkation Center at Le Mans, France. From February 23, 1919,
to March 4, 1919, he commanded the Forwarding Camp at Le Mans,
France. During the period March 5 to 21, 1919, Brig. Gen. Cole
was occupied in inspecting the units of the Fifth Brigade. He left
Tours, France, on March 31, arrived at Brest, France, same day, was
detached from the American Expeditionary Forces on March 31,
and sailed for the United States on the <i>Mauretania</i>, arriving at New
York April 7, 1919.</p>

<p>Brig. Gen. Smedley D. Butler relieved Brig. Gen. Cole as commanding
general of the brigade on April 9, 1919, and retained command
until it was demobilized in August, 1919.</p>

<p>One of the most prominent and outstanding features of the American
Expeditionary Forces was the administration of Pontanezen
Camp at Brest, France, by Brig. Gen. Smedley D. Butler, United
States Marine Corps, from October 6, 1918, to the latter part of July,
1919. The words of the citation conferring upon him the Army
distinguished service medal describes in general terms the important
work accomplished by Brig. Gen. Butler:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Smedley D. Butler, brigadier general, United States Marine Corps. For exceptionally
meritorious and distinguished services. He has commanded with ability
and energy Pontanezen Camp at Brest during the time in which it has developed
into the largest embarkation camp in the world. Confronted with problems of
extraordinary magnitude in supervising the reception, entertainment, and departure
of the large numbers of officers and soldiers passing through this camp, he has solved all
with conspicuous success, performing services of the highest character for the American
Expeditionary Forces.</p>
</div>

<p>Brig. Gen. Butler returned to the United States in command of
the Fifth Brigade, on the <i>Siboney</i>, arriving at Hampton Roads, Va.,
on August 8, 1919.</p>

<hr class="r15">

<h3>CITATIONS IN FRENCH ARMY ORDERS.</h3>

<p>The French Army recognized the splendid work of the Fifth and
Sixth Regiments of Marines by citing them three times in Army
orders for achievements in the Chateau-Thierry sector, the Aisne-Marne,
and the Meuse-Argonne (Champagne). The Sixth Machine
Gun Battalion was similarly cited for its work in the Chateau-Thierry
sector and the Aisne-Marne, and the Fourth Brigade for
its work in the Chateau-Thierry sector.</p>

<p>Information was received in January, 1920, that the War Department
had accepted the award of the French fourragère in the colors
of the ribbon of the <span lang="fr">Croix de Guerre</span> for several Army organizations
and the three units of the Fourth Brigade.</p>

<p>Prior to this date the only American organizations which had
received permission to accept or wear the French fourragère were
three sections of the ambulance service and one aero squadron, all
of which were temporary organizations and have now been demobilized.</p>

Marines were in Europe with the American Expeditionary Forces a
total of 504 days, of which 66 days were in active sectors and 71 in
quiet sectors.</p>

RIFLE PRACTICE—RIFLE AND PISTOL COMPETITIONS.</h2>

<hr class="r15">

<h3>RIFLE PRACTICE.</h3>

<p>In recent years the Marine Corps has devoted a great deal of time
and energy to rifle practice, believing that one of the first requirements
of a soldier is to know how to shoot. During the period of the
war target practice was given special attention, and in 1918 it was
announced that no enlisted men would be sent overseas who had
not qualified as marksman or better. This announcement created
even greater interest than before in target practice among the enlisted
personnel and gratifying results were obtained on all rifle ranges.
The Marines that arrived in France were educated riflemen, but
despite that fact rifle ranges of some character were established and
used in every spot of France and Germany where the Marines remained
long enough to make it feasible and practicable to do so.</p>


<p>The percentage of marksmanship qualifications of the enlisted personnel
of the Marine Corps on various dates, in the American Expeditionary
Forces and in the United States was as follows:</p>

AVIATION.</h2>

<hr class="r15">

<h3>STRENGTH AND DISTRIBUTION.</h3>

<p>On April 6, 1917, the Marine section of naval aviation consisting
of five officers and 30 enlisted men, was stationed at the naval air
station, Pensacola, Fla., as part of the complement of that station.</p>

<p>During April, May, and June, 1917, the Marine aviation section was
transferred to a combination land and water station for Marine fliers
at the navy yard, Philadelphia, Pa., and the training of personnel for
land flying began. The official designation of this organization was
the Marine Aeronautic Company. Training in observation balloons
was done in addition to the heavier-than-air work.</p>

<p>On October 12, 1917, this Marine Aeronautic Company, then consisting
of 34 officers and 330 enlisted men, was divided into the First
Aviation Squadron, consisting of 24 officers and 237 enlisted men,
and the First Marine Aeronautic Company, consisting of 10 officers
and 93 enlisted men.</p>

<p>On October 14, 1917, the First Marine Aeronautic Company was
transferred to Cape May, N. J., and took over the naval air station at
that place.</p>

<p>On December 7, 1917, the First Marine Aeronautic Company, then
consisting of 12 officers and 133 enlisted men, was ordered to Naval
Base 13, Ponta Delgada, Azores, arriving there on January 21, 1918.
This company was the first completely equipped American aviation
unit to leave the United States for service in the war. This organization
operated an antisubmarine patrol station of 10 <em>R-6</em> seaplanes,
2 <em>N-9</em> seaplanes, and later 6 <em>HS-2-L</em> flying boats until the station was
ordered abandoned on January 24, 1919, when it was ordered to
return to the United States, arriving at the Marine flying field,
Miami, Fla., March 15, 1919. Maj. Francis T. Evans was in command
from January 9 to July 18, 1918, and Maj. David L. S. Brewster
from July 19, 1918, to January 20, 1919.</p>

<p>On October 17, 1917, the First Aviation Squadron was transferred
from the Marine flying field, navy yard, Philadelphia, Pa., to the
Army training field at Mineola, Long Island, where instruction and
training were carried on in land flying. On December 31, 1917, this
organization was transferred to Gerstner Field, Lake Charles, La.,
for advanced training.</p>

<p>In March, 1918, the Marine flying field, Miami, Fla., was established
and on March 31, 1918, the First Aviation Squadron was transferred
to that field from Lake Charles, La.</p>

<p>Four Marine squadrons of land-fighting planes and a headquarters
company were organized to operate under the Navy as the Day Wing
of the Northern Bombing Group, in northern France, which operated
in the Dunkirk area against German submarines and their bases at
Ostend, Zeebrugge, and Bruges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>On July 13, 1918, the first Marine aviation force, consisting of
Squadrons A, B, C, and Headquarters Company, left Miami, Fla.,
and embarked on board the <i>De Kalb</i> at New York City for France,
July 18, 1918. This organization consisted of 107 officers and 654
enlisted men, and when Squadron D joined in October, 1918, it consisted
of 149 officers and 842 enlisted men. On July 30, 1918, the
Day Wing disembarked at Brest, France, and proceeded to its aerodromes
between Calais and Dunkirk, where they established camp
and prepared the aerodromes for use. The personnel of the Day Wing
was completely organized and ready for service two weeks after their
arrival in France. Part of the planes and equipment of this organization
arrived at Pauillac, France, before the organization reached
France on July 30, 1918. On September 28, 1918, one plane was
delivered to the Marine Day Wing. On October 5, 1918, Squadron D
of the Day Wing, consisting of 42 officers and 188 enlisted men, arrived
at Le Franc aerodrome, completing the four squadrons of the Day
Wing. During the month of October additional planes were delivered
to the Day Wing.</p>

<p>In order to prevent the personnel, who were completely trained
and ready for action when they reached the front, August 2, 1918,
from getting badly out of practice, the commanding officer, Day Wing,
requested permission from the British aviation forces in the vicinity
to be allowed to assign certain Marine pilots to operate with their
squadrons until the Marine planes were delivered. As many Marine
pilots as could be accommodated were operating with British squadrons
until the end of the war, and were highly complimented by
the British officers. The Day Wing, carried out 14 independent
raids far behind the enemy lines, did considerable damage, and
brought back valuable information. The organization participated
actively and creditably in both offensives on the Flanders front.
It was learned after the armistice that one raid resulted in the
death of 60 enemy officers and 300 enlisted men. A feat worthy
of mention was performed by Marine Corps pilots. A French
regiment was cut off by the enemy near Stadenburg. It was decided
to attempt to feed them by aeroplane. Marine Corps pilots loaded
up with food and flew low over this isolated regiment and successfully
dropped 2,600 pounds of food to them in the face of heavy fire from
artillery, machine guns, and rifles. This process was continued for
two days until the regiment was extricated. The number of enemy
planes brought down by Marine pilots, bombs dropped, food dropped,
and other facts of a statistical nature are given elsewhere. Three
pilots were killed or died of wounds received in action, two of them
being shot down over the enemy’s lines.</p>

<p>Maj. Alfred A. Cunningham commanded the Day Wing from the
date of its organization to December 7, 1918, except the period
August 1 to 7, 1918, during which time Maj. Roy D. Geiger was in
command.</p>

<p>While in Europe the Marine fliers served with Squadrons 213 (pursuit
squadron), 217, and 218 (bombing squadrons), Royal Flying
Corps of England; and with pursuit, observation, and bombing squadrons
of the French Flying Corps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>In February, 1918, the Marine aviation section of 8 officers and
40 enlisted men was organized and stationed at the naval air station,
Miami, Fla. The personnel of this section was later increased and
served at that station throughout the war, taking over the deep-sea
scouting of that station. Capt. Thomas R. Shearer was in command
during the entire time.</p>


<h3>STRENGTH AT BEGINNING AND END OF WAR.</h3>

<h3>TRAINING OF OFFICERS AND ENLISTED MEN.</h3>

<p>During the war the Marine Corps selected and trained its own
flyers and mechanics, and had its own aviation field and equipment.
At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, Mass., enlisted
Marines selected as promising flying material and given the rank of
gunnery sergeant, took a 10 weeks’ course in groundwork, and about
80 men a month were graduated. After ground graduation they
did their actual flying at the Marine flying field, Miami, Fla. This
course embraced preliminary, acrobatic, and formation flying, bombing,
gunnery, and reconnaissance work, including photographing.
Upon qualifying they were commissioned as second lieutenants in
the Marine Corp Reserve Flying Corps. Marine flying candidates
were all enlisted Marines, of superior physique, weighing from 135 to
165 pounds, and with at least two years’ college or university study
to their credit. The age limits were 19 to 39 years. Marine Corps
mechanics, riggers, and armorers were trained at the Marine Corps
section of the naval school for mechanics, Great Lakes Training Station,
Chicago, Ill., the course covering eight weeks, and at a similar
school in aviation mechanics at San Diego, Calif.</p>

<p>In December, 1917, 2 Marine officers and 10 enlisted men were
sent to the Army balloon school at St. Louis, Mo., and later to Omaha,
Nebr., for training.</p>

<h3>RETURN OF MARINE AVIATORS FROM EUROPE.</h3>

<p>Early in December, 1918, the Day Wing received orders to return
to the United States, and embarked on December 6, 1918, on board
the <i>Mercury</i> at St. Nazaire, France, arriving at Newport News, Va.,
December 21, 1918.</p>

<p>The First Marine Aeronautic Company returned from the Azores
in March, 1919, arriving at the Marine flying field, Miami, Fla., on
March 15, 1919.</p>

MARINE CORPS RESERVE.</h2>

<hr class="r15">

<p>On April 6, 1917, the strength of the Marine Corps Reserve, all
classes, was 36; the enlisted strength of the Naval Militia, Marine
Corps Branch, of the various States, was 928.</p>

<p>On April 1, 1917, the Naval Militia, Marine Corps Branch, attained
its highest strength, 1,046. There was no recruiting for the Naval
Militia, Marine Corps Branch, after April 1, 1917, and in consequence,
the enlisted personnel of that branch showed a steady
decrease subsequent to that date, owing to discharges and rejections.</p>

<p>On July 1, 1918, the Naval Militia, Marine Corps Branch, then the
National Naval Volunteers, Marine Corps Branch, consolidated
with the Marine Corps Reserve in pursuance with the provisions
of an act of Congress, approved July 1, 1918, and in consequence
thereof became members of class 2, Marine Corps Reserve.</p>

<p>On November 16, 1918, the Marine Corps Reserve attained its
highest strength, 6,773.</p>

RETURN OF MARINES FROM EUROPE—PARADES IN THE UNITED STATES.</h2>

<hr class="r15">

<h3>RETURN OF SECOND DIVISION AND FOURTH BRIGADE.</h3>

<p>A great many Marines were returned from Europe gradually and in
small detachments from the date the armistice became operative.</p>

<p>The commanding general of the Second Division and his staff,
headquarters of the Fourth Brigade, the Fifth Regiment, and the Second
Battalion of the Sixth Regiment arrived in the United States on
board the <i>George Washington</i> on August 3, 1919; the remainder of the
Sixth Regiment arrived in the United States early in August, 1919,
on board the <i>Rinjdam</i> and the <i>Wilhelmina</i>; the Sixth Machine Gun
Battalion arrived in the United States on board the <i>Santa Paula</i> on
August 5, 1919.</p>


<h3>RETURN OF THE FIFTH BRIGADE.</h3>

<p>The Fifth Brigade Headquarters, the Thirteenth Regiment (less
Company B), and the Fifth Brigade Machine Gun Battalion arrived
in the United States on board the <i>Siboney</i> on August 8, 1919. Company
B of the Thirteenth Regiment arrived on the <i>Mercury</i> on August
12, 1919. The Eleventh Regiment arrived in the United States on
board the <i>Orizaba</i> on August 9, 1919.</p>

<p>All the above Marine organizations and individuals were returned
to the naval service soon after arrival in the United States.</p>


<h3>COMPOSITE REGIMENT, THIRD ARMY.</h3>

<p>The company of Marines and battalion commander (major) and
staff, forming a part of the Composite Regiment, Third Army, returned
to the United States on board the <i>Leviathan</i> on September 8,
1919, and were returned to the naval service in September, 1919.</p>

<p>The colonel commanding the Composite Regiment in a letter dated
September 21, 1919, commended the battalion commander and staff,
the commanding officer of the company, and “the lieutenants for their
loyalty and attention to details, and noncommissioned officers and
men for their soldierly appearance, high standard of morale, and
discipline,” concluding with these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Composite Regiment paraded as escort to the general of the Army, in London,
Paris, New York, and Washington, D. C. The regiment has been favorably commended.
This is entirely due to the loyalty, energy, and attention to duty of the
officers and individual soldiers in the regiment; and in this the Marine Corps representatives
deserve a large share.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>


<h3>SCHLESWIG-HOLSTEIN BATTALION.</h3>

<p>With the return of the above Marine organizations, all Marines of
the American Expeditionary Forces were out of Europe with the exception
of a few individuals, and the Fifteenth Separate Battalion, consisting
of 26 officers and about 700 enlisted men, which was retained
for duty in France for possible operations in connection with the
Schleswig-Holstein plebiscite.</p>

<p>This battalion, under command of Maj. Charles F. B. Price, was
organized at Pontanezen Camp, Brest, in July, 1919, from personnel
of the Fourth and Fifth Brigades and the Twelfth Separate Battalion.
The battalion designation was changed on August 15 from “Provisional
Battalion, U. S. Marines,” to the “Fifteenth Separate
Battalion.”</p>

<p>The Battalion rendered honors to Gen. Pershing on September 1,
1919, upon his departure from France at Brest and on the same day
was inspected by Marshal Foch, who commended the Battalion on
its splendid appearance.</p>

<p>Leaving Brest on the <i>Mercury</i>, September 3, 1919, the Battalion
six days later arrived at Bordeaux to take part in the ceremony of
laying a foundation for a monument commemorating the entrance
of the United States into the World War, at Pointe de Grave, near
Bordeaux, France. It then returned to Brest and in December
went on board the <i>Henderson</i>, then at that port. The <i>Henderson</i>,
with the Battalion on board, sailed from Brest, arriving at Philadelphia
on December 23, 1919, after a 16-day trip. On December
30, 1919, the battalion arrived at Quantico, Va.</p>


<h3>RETURN OF AVIATION UNITS.</h3>

<p>Information regarding the return of Marine Corps aviation units
from Europe will be found in <a href="#Chapter_XXI">chapter XXI</a>.</p>


<h3>PARADES IN THE UNITED STATES.</h3>

<p>On August 8, 1919, the Fourth Brigade, as a part of the Second
Division, paraded in New York City. Maj. Gen. John A. Lejeune,
with many Marine officers on his staff, was in command.</p>

<p>On August 8, 1919, the Fourth Brigade of Marines was transferred
to the naval service upon its arrival at Quantico, Va.</p>

<p>On August 12, 1919, the Fourth Brigade of Marines, then a part of
the naval service, was reviewed by the President of the United
States in a parade at Washington, D. C. Brig. Gen. Wendell C.
Neville was in command.</p>

<p>A company of Marines and a battalion commander, as a part of the
Third Army Composite Regiment, paraded in New York and in Washington,
D. C., as escort to Gen. Pershing. The First Division also
formed a part of these parades.</p>

<br>
DEMOBILIZATION.</h2>

<hr class="r15">

<p>Immediately upon the armistice becoming operative on November
11, 1918, the question of demobilization became one of paramount
importance. It was necessary that plans be at once put into effect
providing for the release from service at the earliest possible date of
duration-of-war men and reservists. While authority existed to hold
such men for several months after the ratification of the peace treaty,
the popular demand for the return and discharge of all who could be
spared was only natural. Parents, relatives, and friends could see no
necessity for the keeping of their loved ones in the service after actual
fighting ceased.</p>

<p>The problem before the Marine Corps was serious, as a wholesale
reduction at that time would have seriously crippled its efficiency.
Therefore, on November 20, 1918, in Marine Corps Orders No. 56,
orders were issued to the service stating that it was the desire of headquarters
to release those members of the Marine Corps Reserve and
those men of the Regular Service, who enlisted for the duration of the
war, who wished to complete their education, or who had urgent family
and business interests demanding immediate and personal attention.
Thus demobilization to a limited extent was begun nine days
after the signing of the armistice.</p>

<p>On May 1, 1919, it became necessary, owing to the demands of the
service and the reduction of the enlisted personnel, temporarily to
limit the privilege of discharge to men whose release was necessary
for urgent financial dependency reasons.</p>

<p>Following the approval of the act of July 11, 1919, which act provided
sufficient funds to sustain the corps only at an average enlisted
strength of 27,400 men, with corresponding officers, Marine Corps
Orders No. 42, July 12, 1919, were published, establishing demobilization
centers and promulgating detailed instructions for the complete
demobilization. Under this plan duration-of-war men were discharged
as rapidly as the exigencies of the service permitted. Those
men who were serving in the Tropics who were eligible for discharge
and desired their release were returned to the United States as rapidly
as practicable, and orders were issued for their discharge and awaited
them at the time of joining a Marine barracks, thus minimizing delay
in allowing them to go home. By the latter part of December, 1919,
practically all of the duration-of-war personnel had been discharged.</p>

<p>In August, 1919, the Fourth and Filth Brigades of Marines, which
had been serving with the Army in France, were returned to the
Marine barracks, Quantico, Va., and the naval operating base, Hampton
Roads, Va., respectively, at which places the demobilization of
these two organizations was effected. This undertaking was by far
the largest and most important of its kind that had ever confronted
the Marine Corps, but due to the coordination of the various departments<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
interested, and the far-reaching and clearly defined instructions
issued in advance the demobilization of these units was effected in a
remarkably short time, being completed on August 13, 1919, and in a
manner bringing satisfaction to the men discharged, and reflecting to
the credit of the corps. The success of these efforts is evidenced by
the following statement of demobilization:</p>

<p class="fs80 negin2 pad10">
Discharged or transferred to inactive status:<br>
Fourth Brigade, 6,677 enlisted men.<br>
Fifth Brigade, 6,671 enlisted men.<br>
</p>

<p>In addition to the enlisted men released there were also about two
hundred officers of the two brigades who were either discharged or
transferred to an inactive status. Due to the diligent cooperation of
those concerned the demobilization was carried out with a degree of
success far beyond expectations.</p>


<h3>MARINES ARE WELCOMED HOME BY THE NAVY.</h3>

<p>Acting Secretary Roosevelt August 11, 1919, sent to all ships and
stations of the United States Navy the following special order:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Fourth Brigade of the Marine Corps, consisting of the Fifth Regiment, Sixth Regiment,
and the Sixth Machine Gun Battalion, and the Fifth Brigade of the Marine Corps,
consisting of the Eleventh Regiment, Thirteenth Regiment, and Fifth Brigade Machine
Gun Battalion, have returned from service in Europe and have reverted from the
Army to their status in the United States Navy. At this time I wish, on behalf of the
naval service, to welcome them back and express to the officers and men of these organizations
the very deep appreciation of the Navy for their splendid services while with
the Army during the war.</p>

<p>Beginning with the first expeditionary forces which left the United States in June,
1917, over 30,000 officers and men of the Marine Corps have been sent to France. The
Fourth Brigade, as a part of the immortal Second Division, has been engaged in all of
the principal operations of the war. Their record speaks for itself. The Fifth Brigade,
going to France later, furnished many splendidly trained replacements for the Fourth
Brigade and performed arduous tasks according to tradition.</p>

<p>The entire Navy welcomes them home.</p>

<h3>THE SECRETARY OF WAR PRAISES THE FOURTH BRIGADE.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">War Department</span>, <em>August 12, 1919</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent">Hon. <span class="smcap">Josephus Daniels</span>,<br>
<span class="pad8"><em>Secretary of the Navy</em>.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Mr. Secretary</span>: In the process of demobilization, the Marine Brigade,
which by the President’s order became a part of the American Expeditionary Forces
and was thus a part of the forces under the control of the War Department and under
the command of Gen. Pershing, has now been returned to this country, detached from
the Army, and restored to the control of the Navy Department.</p>

<p>I can not permit this heroic force to terminate its association with the Army without
expressing to you, and through you to the officers and men of the Marine Corps, the
deep sentiment of the War Department and of the Army toward it. The whole history
of the Brigade in France is one of conspicuous service; when it was finally incorporated
into the Second Division of the American Army it had early an opportunity to give a
heroic demonstration of the unconquerable tenacity and dauntless courage of American
soldiers. From then on in successive, almost continuous, battles the Marine Brigade
and the division of which it was a part fought sternly and successfully until victory
was obtained for the Allied Armies. Throughout this long contest the Marines, both by
their valor and their tragic losses, heroically sustained, added an imperishable chapter
to the history of America’s participation in the World War.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p>On behalf of the Army I congratulate the Navy Department, the Major General
commanding the Marines, those who have been instrumental in the formation and
training of this splendid organization, and the officers and men of the organization
itself.</p>

<p class="pad4">Cordially, yours,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Newton D. Baker.</span></p>
</div>

<p>In reply Acting Secretary Roosevelt said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Navy Department</span>, <em>August 13, 1919</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent">Hon. <span class="smcap">Newton D. Baker</span>,<br>
<span class="pad4"><em>Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.</em></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Secretary</span>: Your very cordial letter and the tribute it bore to the
Fourth Brigade of Marines was received with pleasure and deepest appreciation. The
heroism of the Marines and the Regulars in the famous Second Division, and their
sacrifices, have endeared them to all Americans, and it is with very pardonable pride
that we welcome them back to the Navy.</p>

<p>The spirit of cordial cooperation between the Army and the Navy was never better
manifested than in the participation of these Marines in the great battles in France
under the command of Gen. Pershing as a part of the United States Army, and shoulder
to shoulder with units of the Regular Army. It is with extreme gratification that
we can look back upon this unbroken cooperation between our two departments that
started at the time the first Navy ship carried troops to France and continued uninterruptedly
through to the end.</p>

<p>On behalf of Secretary Daniels, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, the officers
and men of that organization, I wish to thank you for the sentiments expressed in
your letter and convey to you our appreciation of the heroism of the officers and men
of the Army who with the Marines made the Second Division one of the greatest fighting
organizations the world has ever known.</p>

<p>It is very gratifying in our pride over the achievements of the Marines, to know that
that pride is shared by the War Department and your warm approbation of their
conduct as a part of the Army will be treasured by the Corps as well as by the individuals.</p>

<p>Sincerely, yours,</p>

OFFICE OF THE MAJOR GENERAL COMMANDANT—ADJUTANT
AND INSPECTOR’S DEPARTMENT.</h2>

<hr class="r15">

<p>Maj. Gen. Commandant George Barnett was the Major General
Commandant of the United States Marine Corps during the entire
period of the World War. Originally appointed on February 25,
1914, he was reappointed on February 25, 1918, for a second term
of four years.</p>

<p>On September 29, 1918, Maj. Gen. Commandant George Barnett,
accompanied by Brig. Gen. Charles L. McCawley, sailed from New
York on board the <i>Leviathan</i>, arriving at Brest, France, October 7,
1918. The object of the visit of the Major General Commandant to
France was an inspection of all the Marines serving with the American
Expeditionary Forces, but he fell a victim to the influenza
epidemic which prevented him from carrying out his plans. He
departed from Paris, December 7, 1918, sailed from Brest, December
9, 1918, on board the <i>Leviathan</i>, and arrived in the United
States, December 16, 1918.</p>

<p>Brig. Gen. John A. Lejeune was the Assistant to the Major General
Commandant from December 14, 1914 to September 26, 1917, when
he was transferred to Quantico, Va., to command the Marine barracks.
Brig. Gen. Charles G. Long relieved Brig. Gen. Lejeune and
has acted as Assistant to the Major General Commandant from that
date to the present.</p>

<p>Activities directly under the office of the Major General Commandant
such as personnel, target practice, and aviation, were
carried on efficiently during the war. The Planning Section was
established on December 24, 1918.</p>

<p>Brig. Gen. Charles H. Lauchheimer was the Adjutant and Inspector
of the United States Marine Corps, with station at Headquarters,
during the World War. He became seriously ill, was admitted to
the hospital on July 10, 1919, where he died on January 14, 1920.
Col. Henry C. Haines assumed the duties of Acting Adjutant and
Inspector on August 3, 1919, and upon the death of Brigadier General
Lauchheimer was appointed the Adjutant and Inspector.</p>

<p>A great amount of additional work was caused by the large
increases and by the war, but the personnel of the Adjutant and
Inspector’s Department performed their duties with efficient satisfaction.</p>

<h3>HOW WAR INCREASES WERE MET.</h3>

<p>The enlargement of the paymaster’s department to meet war conditions
at the beginning of the war, and until the enlisted strength
was raised to 75,500, was effected in the following manner:</p>

<p>1. By the temporary appointment and advancement to the grade
of captain, pursuant to act of May 22, 1919, of eight of the permanent
pay clerks of the department.</p>

<p>2. By the temporary advancement of enlisted men of experience
and long service under this department to the grade of pay clerk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>3. The new enlisted clerical personnel was partly obtained from
enlisted men who had previously been employed as pay roll clerks
at shore stations and aboard ships of the Navy, and from men enlisted
and enrolled from civil life with clerical experience outside.
The men obtained were detailed in the regularly established offices,
and there formed into classes for instruction in their duties, the
commissioned officers and senior clerks being used as instructors for
this purpose. In addition to the above, and to the end of creating
a proper spirit and morale, and bringing about a better understanding
throughout the department of its aims and purposes, a series of lectures
by the Paymaster and subordinate officers was delivered at
headquarters, and afterwards published and distributed to the entire
personnel of the department. Later on, in order to meet the further
increased demand for clerical assistance, a school for the instruction
of men in paymaster’s department work was established at the Marine
barracks, Parris Island, S. C. This was, however, in addition to
the system of instruction previously instituted in the permanently
established offices. The school was of considerable value in that it
aided in the selection and assignment of men (recruits) with previous
clerical experience to duty in the paymaster’s department. The
demand for clerks for both home and overseas service, however, was
so great for some time before the close of the war, that it was not
possible at any time to keep the men under instruction in the school
or in the offices for sufficient length of time to complete the prescribed
course that had been laid out for them. As a consequence, many
men had to be sent out with but a meager idea of the duties they
were to perform. The clerical forces of the permanent offices, therefore,
finally became so drained of experienced clerks and stenographers
taken away to supply the demand for expeditionary and overseas
forces that it became necessary to enlist or enroll women to perform
these duties.</p>

<h3>ADDITIONAL DUTIES DURING WAR.</h3>

<p>The duties of the paymaster’s department during the war were
greatly enlarged and made more complicated and difficult: (1) By
reason of the enactment of the war risk insurance act of October 6,
1917. The work connected with family allotments and war risk insurance
created by this act was of such magnitude as to require the
establishment of a separate administrative section under a commissioned
officer to handle the voluminous correspondence, keep the
records, and make proper audit of these items in the accounts involved.
It was also found necessary in order to facilitate the work
of this section, that a liaison group of clerks be kept in the War Risk
Bureau. (2) By reason of the taking over of the payment of all
Marine Corps allotments, as the deputy of the Navy allotment officer.
(3) By reason of the necessity of having to pay many men on affidavits
without proper records; service record books and other papers
pertaining to their accounts having been lost or destroyed by operation
of war or other accidental circumstances. (4) By reason of
the large number of wounded men, some of whom were scattered in
various hospitals throughout France, and others of whom were returned
to the United States without due notice to military authorities,
and sent to both naval, military, and civil hospitals at widely
scattered points throughout the States. In but a few of these cases
were there any records on which full and accurate payments could be
made. Hence a system of emergency, or casual payments, as they
were called, was established both in France and in the United States.
The absence of records in these cases was not the worst feature however,
but the absence of any information whatever, as to the whereabouts
of the men made it at first impossible to locate some of them
and effect regular payments. However, after the first few months’
experience with the handling of payments to the wounded, a system
was devised by which most of those returning to the States were
immediately reported and prompt payments were thereafter made.
A similar system of emergency or casual payments to wounded men
was adopted by the department in France, but wounded men in
France were evacuated so frequently from one hospital to another,
that no system of reporting was practicable. Each hospital there
had to be visited in person by a paymaster at least once a month
and such wounded Marines as were found, had to be paid on their own
representations a sum sufficient to meet their immediate needs.
Under such a system some necessarily went without pay for some
time, while others more fortunate in meeting a paymaster at frequent
intervals, received at times more money than was properly due
them. (5) By reason of the enactment of February 24, 1919, providing
a gratuity of $60 to all persons in the military and naval forces of
the United States, who were discharged under honorable conditions
at any time subsequent to April 6, 1917. This law necessitated the
establishment at headquarters of a claims section, whose sole duty
was to settle the twenty or thirty thousand supplementary claims
created by this act and the act of February 28, 1919, increasing
the amount of travel allowance to 5 cents per mile to all enlisted
men discharged subsequent to November 11, 1918.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>


<h3>NEW PAY ROLL.</h3>

<p>In addition to the above, it became necessary to adopt a new pay
roll suitable for preparation on the typewriter and so arranged as to
make it adaptable for use as a combination pay and muster roll,
should this be deemed necessary. This roll was prescribed and put
into use in the midst of the war without much confusion, and it is
understood resulted in a saving of much clerical labor to the organization
commanders.</p>


<h3>OFFICE OF THE CHIEF PAYMASTER, U. S. MARINES, FRANCE.</h3>

<p>In obedience to orders dated October 2, 1917, and in compliance
with provisions of G. H. Q. General Orders No. 38(2), September
17, 1917, the “Office of the Chief Paymaster, U. S. Marines, France,”
was established in Paris, France, on October 5, 1917. Maj. Davis
B. Wills was Chief Paymaster, U. S. Marines, France, from that date
until the office was abolished in August, 1919.</p>

<br>
QUARTERMASTER’S DEPARTMENT.</h2>

<hr class="r15">

<p>Brig. Gen. Charles L. McCawley, was the Quartermaster of the
United States Marine Corps, with station at Headquarters, during
the entire war. Brig. Gen. McCawley, in company with the Major
General Commandant, sailed from the United States on board the
<i>Leviathan</i> September 29, 1918, arriving at Brest, France, October 7,
1918. After an extended visit to the Marines as an observer Brig.
Gen. McCawley sailed from Brest on board the <i>De Kalb</i> December 9,
1918, arriving in the United States, December 16, 1918.</p>

<p>Upon the increase of the Marine Corps from 17,400 to 30,000 and
later to 75,500, it became necessary to increase the commissioned,
warrant, and enlisted personnel of the quartermaster’s department,
in order that it might successfully meet the heavy demands made
upon it by the war and by the large increase in strength.</p>

<p>The increase in the commissioned personnel was made largely by
the promotion of experienced quartermaster clerks and quartermaster
sergeants to commissioned rank, and the vacancies in the grade of
quartermaster sergeant were filled, as far as possible, from selected
enlisted men.</p>

<p>Later a school for the instruction of quartermaster sergeants was
organized at Marine barracks, Norfolk, and three classes were
graduated therefrom.</p>

<p>It was necessary to make large increases in the personnel at headquarters
to handle the question of supply, transportation, construction,
and finance. The table below shows the strength in the office
of the quartermaster on January 1, 1917, and June 30, 1918:</p>

<h3>ADDITIONAL STOREHOUSES AND COOPERATION WITH GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.</h3>

<p>Due to changes in the method of purchasing rations, caused by
existing conditions, it became necessary to establish commissary
storehouses at San Francisco, Charleston, and Baltimore, at which
to maintain reserve supply stores. The Baltimore storehouse was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
later moved to Philadelphia. At the beginning of the war the
Marine Corps had in its depots at Philadelphia, Pa., and San Francisco,
Calif., a small surplus stock, which had been accumulated from
the regular appropriations, sufficient to outfit 8,500 men; consequently
when the war was declared against Germany and the corps
was increased, first to 1,323 officers and 30,000 men (act May 22,
1917), and secondly to 3,341 officers and 75,500 men (act July 1,
1918), it was necessary to provide simultaneously clothing, equipage,
food, and shelter for these men. The question of shelter is discussed
in the following pages. In connection with the purchase of these
supplies it must be remembered that the Army, Navy, and Allies
were in the market for similar articles, and in order to determine
supply and allocate demands the President first appointed a Council
of National Defense, which was later superseded by the War Industries
Board. The quartermaster’s department had representatives
in daily attendance at the various meetings of the committees of the
Council of National Defense, and later the War Industries Board.
All of the above-mentioned supplies, as far as practicable, were purchased
in the usual manner, by the bid and tender plan, only those
articles on which no bids were received or those controlled by the
War Industries Board being allocated.</p>

<p>There was installed in the office of the quartermaster a “follow-up”
system, where record was made of all orders, contracts, purchase
orders, and requests for transfer of supplies from other departments.
The function of this section was to see that the supplies were delivered
in accordance with contract obligations and trace delinquent
deliveries. The section has proven its value, and satisfactory deliveries
have been obtained, with few exceptions. From these records
the quartermaster has available at all times the status of all outstanding
orders as well as a concise record of completed contracts.</p>


<h3>CANTONMENTS.</h3>

<p>To furnish accommodations for the increased personnel, cantonments
on a large scale were built at Quantico, Va., and Parris Island,
S. C., and on a smaller scale at Mare Island, Calif. This work was
expeditiously handled and afforded suitable temporary accommodations
during the war.</p>


<h3>DEPOT OF SUPPLIES, PHILADELPHIA, PA.</h3>

<p>During the period of the war the depot outfitted and equipped
36 expeditionary units for service in France and the West Indies, and
over 31,000,000 pounds of various kinds of supplies were shipped on
Government bills of lading. The depot departments were so organized
that it was only necessary to expand each division of the office forces
and increase the number of employees and machines in the manufacturing
departments in order to meet the increased demands during
the war. The personnel of the depot on June 30, 1919, was as follows:
Thirteen commissioned officers, 7 warrant officers, 2 civilians,
102 enlisted men of the regular service, 21 reservists, and 1,095
other employees of all classes, making a total personnel of 1,240.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span></p>


<h3>DEPOT OF SUPPLIES, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIF.</h3>

<p>The activities of this depot were increased during the war by the
greater number of recruits to be outfitted on the west coast, and by
the establishment of the subsistence branch of the depot at San
Francisco. This depot has supplied all posts on the west coast,
and furnished the supplies for the troops in the Orient.</p>


<h3>DEPOT OF SUPPLIES, CHARLESTON, S. C.</h3>

<p>This depot was established soon after the declaration of war for
the purpose of supplying all posts south of Norfolk, including the
West Indies. The storage facilities consist of 7 warehouses and a
total floor space of 124,778 square feet. A total of about 14,287
tons of stores were shipped from this depot during the fiscal year
1919, these stores being valued at approximately $12,000,000;
during the same period approximately 18,000 tons of stores were
received, at an estimated value of $15,000,000. Practically all
shipments of supplies of every description for troops in the West Indies
are made from this depot.</p>


<h3>EXPENDITURES.</h3>

<p>The expenditures of the quartermaster’s department for the fiscal
years ending June 30ths, 1917, 1918, and 1919, were as shown below,
exclusive of appropriations for public works, under the Navy Department,
from which figures the enormous increase in the activities
and responsibilities of this department, caused by the war and by the
increase in strength, is evident:</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;

work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works.

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
